									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The brain has an incredible ability to heal and change throughout its lifespan. Everyone brings a unique set of individual strengths to this life. My hope is that my writing will assist individuals throughout their own healing process and provide tools for those walking alongside others who share similar experiences to mine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I grew up in Southwest Michigan and moved to Grand Rapids in 2012 to continue my education in social work. My hobbies include spending time with loved ones, enjoying the outdoors, writing, reading, and making memories with my dog, Arya. My perfect day includes time spent in meaningful conversations and sharing many laughs with close friends. I believe that our closest connections are what build resiliency and strength as we navigate the joys and hardships of life.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This blog will include many details relating to physical, sexual, mental, and emotional abuse. If trauma stories such as this are something that might trigger you, I encourage you to do what is best for yourself even if that means refraining from reading this blog or moving at a pace that works well for you. If you are someone who finds such topics helpful in your own life then grab a blanket, cozy up, and join me during this chapter of my journey.
										<br><br>
										Much Love,
										<br>

									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Barely tall enough to peer over the top of the mattress, I stand at the foot of my parents’ bed. Crammed into the back room of our tiny mobile home, the bed and dressers leave little space for movement. Evening is setting in and the sun gleams through the window, leaping off the back of the figure in front of me. It is a man. Sitting tall and colossal, he speaks to me. Glancing up curiously, I wonder why he has brought me here. I am only four  years old, and it is all so bewildering to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Where were my parents? I ask now. True to character, Dad must have been downing drinks at the corner tavern. And Mom must have been at church, or more likely, socializing with another man for attention. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You do this and just put your mouth on it," the strange man educates steadily, as if to teach me something valuable. My brain has reduced his face to that of a shadow being engulfed by the gazing sun. What I know for certain is that the man in the memory is not my older brother, Josiah. My first perpetrator is not the one whom my childhood self would soon know as my full-time abuser. This man was different, older, taller, yet a person whom I must have known well at the time. Eyes shifting down to the long body part in front of my face, I squint in confusion, feeling uncertain while continuing as instructed. This is my very first memory. Innocence stolen so young that I will never know what life prior to abuse was like. The trauma memories would remain trapped in the body for years to come, attempting escape through murmurs so indistinct that their silent echos would remain buried.

									<h2><i>Illusion</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was born and raised in a pleasant beach town called South Haven, and I truly wish my life’s story reflected the beauty of its majestic dunes, birch trees, and gentle waters. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Situated just below Canada and shaped like a mitten, Michigan is known for its grueling winters: freezing temperatures, heavy snowfalls, and dark skies. But by the month of June, warm summer breezes shift the skies from gloomy to pleasant, and the ghost town of South Haven becomes a resort town bustling with tourists who enjoy the quaint shopping district, high-end seasonal restaurants and long sandy beaches of Lake Michigan. Some say that on a clear day, the Chicago skyscrapers can be seen from across the lake, others argue that is just an illusion--for the Windy City is a full one hundred miles across the freshwater lake.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The lake bluffs are filled with million dollar vacation homes owned largely by people from Illinois, whom locals refer to as FIPs, “Fucking Illinois People”. Although the visitors keep the town financially afloat, warm months come with too many people crammed into a small space and it feels suffocating to me. As the season ends and the town empties, the low income residents like my family go back to living their hard-scrabble lives and scraping by with limited resources. The wealth of the area is an illusion for us too.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Many say that even with this duplicity, I am lucky to grow up in such a picturesque place. In some ways, I agree. But in others, I contemplate what being born in a different location, with an entirely different family, might have been like for me. Had I grown up in a nurturing environment with love, acceptance, and structure, would I be the person I am today? Would I be something greater? Or worse? Would I even wonder about this? These are questions which I will never know the answer to because I wasn’t raised in a safe, caring home. Far from it. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Just two miles from the beach, South Haven quickly transitions into the countryside which is where Dad bought fifty acres of deer hunting land many years prior to my birth. On this swampy, flat land was a mobile home trailer that housed nine children, two adults, and entirely too many animals over the next twenty years.  And, for the longest time, the memories of the land and its people were lost to me, but once I recalled it all, I knew I must share it all.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;On February 20, 1994, I was born in the small white trailer with brown shutters located on County Road 384. After many hospital births, Mom felt God calling her away from worldly Western medicine. It was a Sunday morning and her midwife, Marian, helped deliver me in my parents’ bed.  There would be no medical intervention for labor--not even a simple aspirin--for this was deemed unholy. Like all of the women in Mom’s evangelical Christian community, Marian didn’t cut her hair because it was immodest and worldly to look anything but a proper female, pure as the Virgin Mary. Her dark brown tresses grew well past her waist, but would have been pulled back into a single, tightly woven, French braid for “women’s work” such as this. Her face was always calm, unadulterated, and supported by a peaceful character. I imagine she and Mom sharing tears that night as they realized that after five boys, Mom had finally birthed the daughter that she spent so many years praying for.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At only nineteen years old, just months after my parents married, Mom birthed my eldest brother, K.J.. A few years later came Jason, then another gap before she had Josiah. After that, Mom gave birth every two years to: Chase, Abe, and then me. Once I came along, Mom decided that God trusted her to have as many offspring as she could.  Thus came Sarah, Dylan, and then at age forty, her final child, Avalon. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We don’t have many photos of all eleven of us together because by the time the last two came around, the first two had already moved out of the trailer. Our best family photo was before Avalon’s birth--and Mom was beyond excited. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Here Kelly, put on this dress!” she hurriedly instructed after tying my wavy blond hair back with a lace bow. She had made a special trip to Walmart for the dress. It was pretty, laced, and in my favorite color, light pink. After some shouting, complaining, and spit-shining, the ten of us piled into our twelve passenger church van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The wait outside of the “Walmart Portrait Studio” was a long one for the ten of us. We had to stay clean, groomed and well-behaved for what seemed like hours. Legs aching from waiting in line, our turn finally arrived. Mom’s enthusiasm was shared by Dad as we rushed to gather for our picture. Unexpectedly, things became tense. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You can’t turn us away! We came all this way to have our picture taken!” Dad yelled at the photographer. You see, there are things that we forget to take into consideration with big families, one of them being the fact that we might not all fit into a discount store’s little photo room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was able to tune out the harshness of Dad’s voice by focusing on my aching legs, itchy dress, and dolls waiting at home. Tension continued to build in the air as the shouting continued, then we abruptly returned to our van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once home, desperate to help Mom get her family picture, Dad set up his camera in our front yard. “You, sit here!” Dad commanded. “And you, stand here,” he directed my older brothers. The camera timer was set, and I squinted a half smile into the bright sun, anxious for the event to be over. We stood at attention: Dad in his best church shirt from JC Penney’s and cleanest jeans, Mom in her hand-sewn prairie dress that draped to the ground, and the nine children with at-home haircuts and traditional, modest clothes. 3, 2, 1 and there it was: a snapshot of the Crystal's in front of the pine trees in all our finest. Looking happy. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But, I could not shake the sadness inside of me about Mom not getting the professional photos she hoped for. It was the first time my chest and stomach felt the aching need to take care of her, a feeling that stayed with me for years to come.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;Months later, the time grew closer for our family to welcome Avalon into this world. The seasons were changing, winter struggling to decide if it was ready to let spring in. The air was cold, barely warm enough for rain to wash away the snow. Throughout Mom’s pregnancy I travelled with her to a small town, Paw Paw, for monthly checkups with Marian. I noticed with curiosity that this town had poles dotting the city streets. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It is a parking meter,” Mom explained, gently teaching me something new. “Here, take a quarter and put it in right there." Feeling excited, I slid the silver into the slot. There were times when I was quite young when I was filled with Mom’s warmth.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I played with baby dolls while waiting for Mom to finish her appointment.  When Marian and Mom joined me in the waiting room, they continued to discuss birthing plans, but it was all foreign to me. No one had explained to me what pregnancy or birth was. What I did know was that Mom’s belly was growing and there was a baby inside that would somehow eventually be outside and that would be my new brother or sister. But how? And why? I did not understand. Based on their deliberate tones, something big was coming. My body became jittery with uncertainty.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Looking up, I observed how big her belly was through her long button-up dress. “There’s a real baby in there?” I asked anxiously.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“There is!” Mom exclaimed then returned to her conversation. My face tensed as I continued to anticipate what was to come--but like so many other times in my life, I was left in the dark. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Mom went into labor a few nights later, I feared something seriously bad was happening. I sat in my nightgown on the couch watching her attentively. She was walking from the kitchen to the living room when she suddenly hunched over and breathed through heavy pain. Her body was an outline, barely visible by the light from above the kitchen sink. She stood up and took another step before collapsing into the shelf that Dad’s record player sat on. I approached her cautiously, wanting to hug her but knowing that I shouldn’t touch her. 
											 <br>
											 &emsp;&emsp;“Oh, yup, I think I’m in labor. And my water broke,” her words pushed through clenched teeth as she clung to the wall beside her. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Immediately, I wished that she was not having a baby. Seeing her in such pain was unbearable.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Get your shoes and coats. You are going to Aunt Katie’s for the night," Dad instructed. Everyone around me appeared frantic and jittery. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please, just let me stay home! I promise that I will be good. I don’t want to be away from Mom!” I pleaded through tears. What if something bad happens to her while I’m gone? Worry settled in. At only six years old, the fear of being abandoned was yoked to me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At Aunt Katie and Uncle Ryan’s, my heavy-chested tears remained uncontrollable. Still in my nightgown, I stood in their kitchen begging to go home. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I want Mom,” I sobbed. The acrid smell of my aunt’s hair salon wafted from the basement and my long hair stuck to the tears on my cheeks. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I want Mom. I want Mom," the words sputtered out repeatedly--emotions so unruly that plans were made, and I was brought home in the middle of the night. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sitting in the dark, quiet, and cluttered living room, I watched a war movie with Dad. My body was calm and at peace as I felt Mom’s presence from her bedroom. The terror of the birth over, I was, for now, safe.

									<h2><i>Left Behind</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;There is something profound about the intensity of certain dreams. Mom would describe my night terrors as “visions from God”--a way of Him communicating to us something that would happen in the future. As a child with deep love and admiration for her, I soaked up Mom’s words and believed this mindset. But, my childhood nightmares came strong and often--and if God was trying to tell me something, it was that I was doomed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My body jerks awake, trembling in fear. Evil looms in the air. As eyes adjust to the dark, shadows make themselves known. They are not people, but clothes strewn on the couch, floor, and bed where my siblings and parents once slept. I am left in this world alone. Lost without the people who I love and need the most.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The clock across the room reads 8:30am. Darkness fills the sky in defiance of the morning. Similar to Left Behind, Tribulation, Revelation and other apocalypse movies that I watch regularly, the rapture has come. Panicking, I burst out the backdoor of the trailer, dashing down the street to my homeschool friend, Shae’s, house. Straining through the gloom, I know the thirty days of darkness that Mom said would come during the “end times” has arrived.   
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Relief sweeps over me as Shae’s mother, Lana, opens the door.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please! You have to help me! I woke up to find that my…” My words are interrupted  as I notice her right hand. There it is. The small numbers reading “666” tattooed in black ink.  Lana’s eyes are different, darker. The evil is within her. My left hand covers the right in efforts to hide the fact that Satan’s mark does not live on me. Why would God take my family and leave me behind? I wonder. My head throbs and I search my surroundings, desperate to hide away from the evil that suddenly fills the world.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The dream skips ahead. People socialize in the basement of Kibby Church, the local Christian Reformed Church where Wednesday night youth groups and homeschool gatherings are held. A musty smell from the old chapel building stuffs the air. Standing outside the storage room, I remember Mom standing in her ankle length jean dress copying school work pages. Her long black hair held back with a fluffy bow clip.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;An aching feeling immerses itself into my stomach, chest, and throat as the copy machine hums in the empty closet. Mom isn’t here. It was just a memory, a longing for her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I scan the room and see my homeschool friends and their families mingling, moving on with life as if nothing has changed. Hiding my right hand, I notice that everyone in the room has “666” ingrained into theirs. Suddenly, Lana’s cold eyes reach mine from across the room. She has noticed my naked hand. I am exposed, no longer able to hide. Even in the dream, my choice is certain. I fear corruption more than death. My body shivers as it anticipates choosing death by a guillotine over allowing itself to be consumed by the demonic evil in the world.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I leap from the dream to a seated position on the couch. Like all other times when I am afraid, every limb of my body shudders with anxiety. I search the living room: Sarah’s four-year-old body is sandwiched against me on the shabby couch. Dylan and Abe are wrapped in blankets sleeping soundly on the toy-filled floor. It is not yet morning and although the nightmare is over, my body trembles as if the experience were real. I scamper to Mom’s bedroom and wake her. Shaky words leave my mouth faster than my brain can process them, explaining my horrific dream.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I sink into her body as she hugs me, knowing that I can never be close enough to fully feel safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh my gosh, Kelly. God has chosen you for this dream. Just like he does with me, he has spoken to you in your sleep. He has shown you a vision of things that are going to happen!” Her voice rises with energy as her certainty in this grows. This is not an abnormal response, as she often shares different dreams of God speaking to her. But this is the first time Mom interprets my dreams as being sent from God.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom believed that me being chosen by God was a gift but I wanted nothing to do with it. If this fear was God’s gift, I would rather not know.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“He must be telling you that the rapture is coming! And when it comes, it will be at 8:30 in the morning, the same time as in your dream!” Her blue eyes glisten with hope. “But Kelly…” her voice drops and her face hangs to defeat. “God must also be telling you that you are going to be left behind, just like you were in the dream." She hugs me in silence as she thinks. I focus on the softness of her cotton nightgown, absorbing the comfort of her smell. “Yes, that’s it. God is telling me that this dream is deeper. It is God telling you that you must have sinned. You need to think really hard about what you might have done to upset him, then change your heart and pray for forgiveness. Here, I will pray for your heart right now. That God will heal you and change you to live in a way that pleases him." I’m already smashed into her body, but she embraces me even tighter, both of us desperate to never let go.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her eyes close as she begins to pray, her words quickly switching from English to unrecognizable gibberish. She is speaking in tongues again. According to Mom, this is her way of accessing God on another level. He is taking over her body and she is speaking to him in his language, but God speaking to me through this dream crushed my little soul. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brain searched for what I must have done to sin against God. Was it because Josiah touched me down there again? I wondered. But I always ask God for forgiveness right after! I reasoned. It settled on, but even before he touches you, you know it is wrong. You have not done enough to stop him from touching you. Yes, that must be the sin. Hopelessness overcame me as I knew that the next time Josiah came for me, my fear of him in that moment would overpower my knowledge of it being a sin and being left behind.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During the following days and weeks, I watched the clock closely at 8:30am every morning waiting in fear for my family to disappear. At six years old, emptiness filled my soul as I knew that there was nothing that I could do to stop the inevitable.
										<br>
									</p>
									<h3>
										Animals I - Ducks
									</h3>
									<p>
										<i>
										&emsp;&emsp;One year, for a science experiment, Mom bought eggs to hatch in an incubator. It was a venture that the local high school-aged homeschoolers had taken on, my older brothers included. Watching ducklings hatch was a miracle in itself. I hovered in awe attempting to understand how life was created inside of a small brown egg. How did ducklings live inside the eggs one second and outside the next? That experiment was the only glimpse of science education that I received prior to public school for mom did not want sinful teachings about the earths creation to steer us away from God.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the ducklings grew, I often watched them staying in their line, following their designated “Momma Duck” closely around the yard. It amazed me that animals could be so closely bonded--and had such strong survival skills. They knew that following their mother was safe--and that there was always safety in numbers.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A few months later I returned from a hike in the backwoods when Sarah approached me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly!” There was strain in Sarah’s voice. “The ducks are dead!” she wailed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? What happened?!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“They were hit by a car. A couple lived, but most are gone.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I continued toward the trailer, not sure what to think. In the kitchen I found Mom, attempting to keep up with endless amounts of household chores. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, did the ducks really die?” My voice was shaking. It couldn’t be true. Taking a hesitant breath through clenched teeth, Mom feigned an expression of sympathy, but her voice lacked any genuine concern, 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yup they died. You wouldn’t believe it! They all just followed each other right into the street!” Using her typical coping mechanism of turning painful events into lighthearted moments, she began laughing. “Just one, right after the other! Can you even believe it?!” she chuckled.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I rushed to the road out front , desperate to see for myself. Someone had removed the bodies, but blood and an unimaginable number of white feathers remained, layering County Road 384. My jaw and chest muscles tightened at the horrific scene, aching at the unexpected loss following a deep love connection. Not knowing what to feel, I pushed the sight from my mind. It took a while, but I was able to convince myself that the ducks lived a good life with a pain-free death. This was my own coping mechanism: following horrific events that my family was cruelly indifferent to, I recreated more pleasant outcomes in my mind. The new scenarios helped my tender heart heal.

									<h2><i>Rhett</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;I always wondered if Mom’s zealous evangelical beliefs stemmed from her younger years when she dabbled in what she called “witchcraft”. She and her younger brother, Rhett, experimented with friends when they were in their late teens and early twenties. Mom spoke of this often, mostly discussing the ouija board, crystals, spells, and enchantments. She spoke of “witches” living in South Haven, explaining that they were women who worked in the dark arts. Although she never specified what kind, she feared how these women communicated with, and worshiped, the devil. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Prior to this, she had grown up Catholic. I am uncertain what prompted her turn away from that faith, but by adulthood she hated Catholics. Her religious reasoning was because of their view of the trinity, but I never fully understood the nuances of this objection. She also believed that they “idolized the Virgin Mary” and did not put enough emphasis on God. Her detest for this faith was so strong that if I met someone who attended the local St. Basil's church, she would mutter “Ugh, she’s Catholic. We better not spend any time with their family.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Because of the evangelical church’s inclusive practice regarding “sinners”, I was able to socialize with families composed of addicts, alcoholics, convicts and child abusers, but heaven-forbid I spend time with someone who associated themselves with the Catholic faith. It didn’t make sense to me why Mom judged some people so harshly--or why someone's religious beliefs made them inherently evil. It was all so confusing to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she left Catholicism behind, that seems like a natural breaking away from her childhood, but I sense there must have been a hard shift away from witchcraft; I can only imagine what happened. I picture her as having a welcoming personality and open mind like me, then one day naively partaking in a pagan ritual that frightened her somehow. As a child, I told myself that was why Mom is the way she is: her religious views must have come from a bad experience that scared her into believing in a punishing God. That would make sense why she was so fanatical about her brand of Christianity. But I really don’t know.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall driving through South Haven, there were nearly ten houses that she would gesture to and warn, “A witch lives there. Don’t ever go into that house!”. A mile up the street she would point to another house, “The woman who lives there uses a ouija board and does witchcraft. Stay away from there too." These remarks came with eye rolls and judgmental tones, then she would shift to a tone of confidence. “These are all houses where Rhett and I used to do witchcraft--UNTIL GOD SAVED US!” And her eyes would glow.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Rhett died at a young age, still in his early twenties. Perhaps this was another turning point for Mom. Both she and Grandma Williams had supernatural takes on his death. Every so often throughout my childhood, Mom would wake up and excitedly tell us, “I had a dream about your Uncle Rhett last night! He was dead after being trampled by a horse but then he woke up and started talking to me! It is a vision from God that Rhett is alive and in heaven with him! He must have prayed and gotten saved right before he died!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One time, Mom’s dream went as far as: “Uncle Rhett told me that I will have a kid who will become a pastor! And that kid is Jacob! It’s a sign from the Lord! Oh thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus!” Her eyes were always glowing after such dreams. Her spirit and energy lifted. No sign of the heaviness that she usually carried. This made me uncomfortable. It felt as if she interpreted everything in her life being about God. It was an obsession that took priority over the wellbeing of her kids--something she couldn’t overcome. I didn’t understand why a dream couldn’t just be a dream. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During a time when I lived with Grandma Williams, she shared her viewpoint: “Rhett was always hanging out with those friends who did witchcraft. Finally, he came to me, and said, ‘Mom, I’m done. I can’t do it anymore and have decided to stop hanging out with those friends.’ And he did! Then one day, his friend wanted him to come over and talk. I told Rhett not to go, that he would just get sucked back into it. But he said he wanted to go anyway." Her voice was heavy with regret and disappointment of not trying harder to stop him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Gram’s hair was short and dyed red to cover the grey, and she had a long scar under her chin from when she had surgery to remove extra skin. A golden necklace with an oval trinket always hung from her neck, a gift that Rhett gave her just weeks before his death. She continued, “He was on his way there when the drunk driver hit him. The car caught fire and he was trapped.”  They had to use the “jaws of life” to get him out. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the hospital, they learned that the majority of his body had fourth degree burns. If he lived, his body would remain severely scarred and the healing process would be excruciatingly painful as his nerves healed. Grandma made the tough decision for the doctors to “pull the plug”.  She came to terms with his death by explaining: “I believe that if Rhett had made it to his friend’s house, he would have gotten sucked back into witchcraft. I think that God let him die as a way of saving him from that.” I always felt confused by this response, wondering why a God with such power would choose to kill someone over intervening in some other way.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom developed a similar mindset about life, believing that when good things happened to us, God was rewarding us for good behavior and when hardships came, it was a punishment from not living in a Godly way. She compared it to the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. God tested Abraham’s faith by telling him to sacrifice his own son. Then when he went to kill his son, God spared him because of his strong faith.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Grandma told the story of Rhett, her voice softened and took on a higher pitch, as if trying to fight tears. She would remove a box of his belongings from her guest room closet. Then, putting his clothes to her nose, she cried silent tears. “The cologne is in the box. It all still smells like him.”  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For the remainder of her life, her blue Honda CR-V could be found around town with a bumper sticker that read: “A DRUNK DRIVER KILLED MY SON”.
										
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										

										&emsp;&emsp;As one might expect, the death Rhett significantly affected my grandmother and my mother, but Mom’s reaction was to cling to her evangelical beliefs with a ferocity. Since I could remember, Mom believed that Satan was regularly working to attack her for choosing God over witchcraft. Around the age of six, when I remember my doomsday nightmares starting, Mom shared her own experiences with spiritual warfare. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“When K.J. and Jacob were toddlers, your dad and I separated because he was going behind my back with another woman. One night I was sitting in bed when my bedroom lights started flickering. Then, my bed lifted off the floor and was hovering. Across the room, I saw a demon. I grabbed my bible from my nightstand and prayed. I said, ‘Lord Jesus, I rebuke this demon!’ Then suddenly, my bed went back to the floor and the lights stopped flickering. God protected me! He knew the demons were out to get me but I prayed and trusted God and he saved me! Ever since then, whenever I see a demon I just pray and it goes away because demons are scared of God. Sometimes I think God is testing me by letting the demons near me to see how I will respond.” I would listen with rapt attention to every word. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Regardless of my age, she would animatedly recount her experiences such as this and sometimes she would tell me stories of people who had been possessed and had taken on animal-like characteristics, such as squirming and hissing like a snake. The demon would be in the person's body, but their voice would change and it would talk through them. There was an entire prayer process before it would leave the person. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Usually,” she explained, “the person didn’t remember what had happened”. But when she told the story, I remembered. I always remembered.  When she spoke, I could see in my mind’s eye a man hissing on our living room floor and a pastor casting the demon out. My imagination in hearing this story made the experience real, and I felt chills in every corner of my body. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I showed my fear, she tried reassuring me, “Oh don’t worry, we are protected. Whenever you feel scared, just pray to God and Satan won’t be able to touch you.” But it didn’t work. The fear remained--as if lodged into my body for eternity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It didn’t help that she encouraged me to watch movies, such as The Apocalypse, Tribulation and Left Behind, which taught me about the “end of times” foretold in the Bible and how to identify Satan moving in the world. We must be ever-vigilant for the end of the world is coming and God’s chosen people would disappear in an event called “the rapture”. Those who were left behind would be stuck in a world ruled by Lucifer. These individuals would be forced to either get the “mark of the beast”, Satan’s numbers reading “666”, on their right hand or forehead. If they refused, Lucifer or his followers would kill them. The idea was, if you chose to die for God over following Satan, you would still get to heaven. It would teach me to know when God is testing me and how to stay strong. For years I became fixated with these movies. Memorizing every line and character. If I wanted to be safe from spiritual warfare, I would need to learn the characteristics of the good people in the movies. That is how I would survive. From these movies, I learned that I would always choose good over evil in this world, no matter how hard the fight. But at six years old, I just couldn’t suss out what was evil and what wasn’t.

										<h3>
										Animals II - Pigs and Chickens
										</h3>


										<p>
											&emsp;&emsp;At an age so young that it is barely memorable, I bonded with our pigs. The pigpen was located in a fenced area that later became our garden. Just outside the barbed wire fence in long dresses and bare feet, I spent many hours with my flat-snouted allies.  Mud squished between my toes as I kneeled, pretending to be a piglet myself. Snort, snuff, roll, grunt. I was a blissful piggy. I didn’t know that they weren’t pets. I was in the dark until one afternoon when I was in the kitchen and Mom approached from outside. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“We are getting the pigs butchered today," she announced nonchalantly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? We can’t! I love the pigs!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“We have to, Kelly. We need the food. That is why we got them--to raise them so that we could eat them.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We did need the food. I knew that much from the number of “dumpster diving” trips that Dad was taking to Gordon Food Service, the bulk food service distributor located a few towns over. My favorite dumpster food was the variety of candy bars that he brought back. “The expiration dates are just suggestions," Mom informed us. “As long as we keep it all frozen, it never goes bad.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The freezer was filled with expired candy, milk, pizza, and vegetables. Oats, ramen noodles, eggs, and endless cereal that we normally lived on couldn’t compare to the expired gourmet meals that he brought home. And of course, anything was better than the milk that Mom made us drink straight from the local dairy farm. “It is unpasteurized and cheaper," she explained. As an adult, I wonder why she lacked concern for us potentially ingesting harmful bacteria from the raw milk. Maybe it was because, lucky for her, Mom was not a milk drinker. She never knew the disgusting taste of what she was encouraging us to consume. The off-white milk was buried by a thick yellow foam of fat and the stench was of cow's body odor--but the taste was worse. I usually resorted to eating my cereal dry.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In addition to our homegrown pork, we ate our chickens. This I wasn’t in the dark about, and it didn’t bother me much.  When Dad chopped their heads off with an axe and explained how amusing it was to watch them run around the yard headless, it was difficult for me to feel attached to them. It didn’t make sense why watching another creature die was fun, but after him chortling with bemusement at their antics, it was. Yes, I felt horrified at first, but never thought about their deaths once they were over. Well, that is until many years later when the memories flooded back in a high school classroom full of my peers and my favorite teacher. Impulsively, I joked about bloody headless chickens just like Dad had, and the eyes of terror that stared back must have been the ones that I myself gave Dad as a child. It wasn’t normal to joke about such things in the mainstream world and unfortunately, I couldn’t take my words back. I couldn’t even swallow. The embarrassment was too great. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Chickens were one thing for young me, but the grief of my piggy friends dying felt unimaginable. The idea of eating them was even worse. As I often did, I constructed a fantasy where everything turned out for the best, convincing myself that we had sold the pigs to a nice family. One that could take better care of them. “Wherever they are, they are happy," I assured myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This mindset worked well, until a rare occasion when we joined as a family to eat dinner. Gazing at the gigantic meal before us, enjoyment about eating together filled the air. It was a giant production in which we sat in order of age which meant that I dined next to my older brother Abe at the bar counter facing into the kitchen.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know we are eating our pigs, right?” he smirked, poking to elicit a reaction.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, it’s not!” My shriek was loud. “The pigs are alive! We sold them!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sure, if that is what you want to believe," his voice remained calm and steady. “Which body part do you think is on your plate?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Stop it! We aren’t eating them!” When my tears formed, his smirk turned to a satisfied laugh.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, be quiet! Why are you yelling? You’re so annoying.” Josiah was aggravated.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, Kelly, be quiet. Your voice hurts our ears," Mom chimed in. There were always so many voices echoing through the little trailer at times like this.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My body shivered with disgust. I could no longer finish my food, but knew that I was not to leave my seat until the plate was empty. My parents rarely paid attention to me, but at times like this, there was a feigned formality. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Will you at least eat my asparagus?” I pleaded with Abe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sure, if you take my corn.” Sneakily, we made the food switch when we were certain that no one was looking.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I remained at the counter long past when everyone else finished, unable to take more than a morsel of a bite at time. When no eyes were on me, I buried my food into the garbage. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look Mom, I finished my food! Can I get up now?” I held my breath, hoping she wouldn’t catch my lie.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, then you may be done with dinner now.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Satisfied, and with an empty stomach, I cleared my plate.

									<h2><i>Bullets and Bipolar Disorder</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom was pregnant with me during her and Dad’s worst domestic violence incident. She always said that his anger came from his younger years when he served as a United States Army Ranger. “Your dad has been through a lot. The army changed him. It really did.” Her face would convey pity. Thinking back, it was this explanation that she used regularly to justify his abusive behavior. Dad had a short fuse and when it lit, his eyes would darken into unrelenting rage and when he exploded, anything in his way would be damaged. Sometimes his momentary lack of sanity would result in us being whipped or the attacking of a pet, but other times, his blow-ups turned so violent it was criminal.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t remember the first time the “Dad shooting the tire out of Rebecca’s car” story was shared with me, but have heard it enough times from Mom and my siblings that it feels like my own memory. It was that horrific.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The story goes: Mom and Dad are arguing over something. I imagine it has something to do with Dad sleeping with another woman or being gone drinking too much. Maybe it has to do with Mom failing to keep the trailer clean or parent effectively. It’s most likely a mixture of many things which would spark a fuse. They are in the kitchen when Dad snaps, shoving Mom against the old faded wallpaper. He is choking her. Then fortunately, he gains enough control to release her.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;At some point during the argument, Mom had called her friend, Rebecca, to pick her up. She lives a mile up the street, across from the tavern where Dad spends his drunken nights. She has a humor that could bruise your belly, but she is not to be tested. When triggered, her army days left her with the same dark fury as Dad. Rebecca calls the police.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Well before the police arrive, she pulls up in her old sedan and Mom crams K.J., Jacob, Chase and Abe into the back seat. Unable to find six-year-old Josiah, she scrambles back to the trailer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She returns in tears, alone. “Kurt won’t let me have him! Just go. We have to get out of here fast!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the car backs out of the driveway, Dad storms through the trailer door with a gun, maybe a pistol or rifle--that part is still unclear since he has so many of them. When they reach the street, just past the white pines that line the yard, he fires.  Rebecca, who is also pregnant, doesn’t hesitate and blasts down the road with the flat tire. Within the month, she would give birth to Kelsey, my lifelong friend, but at this moment she is barreling down County Road 384 with my hysterical pregnant mother, four frightened children and a thumping tire.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly after reaching her house, there is a knock on the door. Everyone sighs with relief when they find the police on the other side with Josiah, not Dad.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When we were adults, Jacob revealed to me that Dad had been pulled over and arrested just down the street. They were uncertain whether he was heading for Rebecca’s, the bar, or Canada. The police informed them they would have shot Dad on the spot had a child not been with him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Jacob also recalls that two months later Mom held a house meeting to discuss the matter of Dad nearly killing his family. “I wrote the judge a letter asking that they release your dad. I do not know why he gets so angry like that, but he doesn’t mean it. It’s just because he loves us so much. Divorce is a sin, so I have to stay with him. As a woman, I am supposed to honor my husband and should not have gotten angry back. It’s really my fault. God calls us to forgive so we will forgive your dad like Jesus wants us to.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Apparently Dad hid the evidence by dumping the gun in the backyard swamp, so between the letter to the judge and the lack of evidence, he was released from jail. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The shooting incident just became another family story. The abuse cycle continued and Mom maintained her stance of God calling her to “turn the other cheek, forgive and forget.” Her children became like ducklings, following their mother into uncertain territory, trusting she would keep them safe, only to be led toward danger. 
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall Mom and Dad’s fuming arguments came daily. One night, I sat in the living room hearing their voices roar in the kitchen. Tucked between the bookshelf and wall,  I pull my knees to my chest. I need to stay out of the warpath. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re crazy. Even the doctor said it. I heard him. He said you are bi-polar. BI-POLAR!  He said it himself and you need to take your lithium because your chemicals are all out of whack and it makes you all crazy. If you want to get better, you take your lithium. Dur dur dur. You would think it would be obvious. I never know what I’m going to get with you! You’re one way one second and a crazy person the next! Your brain is all fucked up!” Dad is taunting her in his best mocking voice while pointing at the side of his head spinning his finger in circles to indicate her being “crazy”. Mom tries to speak but he barks over her. It bellows so loud that my head feels like it might explode. I can’t even hear my own thoughts. These fights happen multiple times per week, and I’m aching for them to stop. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom screams back so hard I worry her vocal cords might rip apart. “Maybe if you were here to help take care of your kids then I wouldn’t have to be crazy! I hate you! I hate you Kurt! I wish you were dead and that I had never met you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!” She becomes louder with each sentence. But no amount of words or screaming could truly express the rage she must have felt. Years later I would learn about bipolar disorder as associated with mood swings that can range between depressive lows and manic highs that can often be managed with medication and psychotherapy. But at such a young age, I feared the worst. Was something going to happen to Mom?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I close my eyes and plug my ears, but it doesn’t drown the sound. My siblings are nowhere in sight; they must be hiding further away.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Racing to my bedroom, I bury myself deep into the closet, disappearing into darkness. Feeling torn, an internal battle begins between wanting the noise gone and needing to hear what is happening.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The moment Mom says, “I am leaving and never coming back! You can raise your kids by yourself and see how well you do!” I knew that it was time to scurry to her van quickly enough to hide in the back before she realizes I’m there. Sometimes, I hide here the moment the fights start, always knowing that this is how they end. I can’t live without my mom and staying with Dad wouldn’t be safe, so I must always be thinking of a plan.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In an effort to regain control, my mind now searches for solutions. Mom thinks we kids are too much now, but if she leaves with just me I can make her happy. Once she sees and knows me, it will be impossible for her to not love me. Mom and I can take on the world together. I will follow every instruction and stay as silent as possible--so silent she won’t even know that I am there. I will make her laugh, and it will be impossible for her to not like me. Then, there will be no way that I am too much and she will have to let me stay. I always manage to convince myself that this will work. But no matter how many times I hide in her van, she always returns me to the trailer the moment she notices.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please Mom, just let me come with you! I will be good! I will be good! I really will Mom! I’ll be good! I promise! You won’t even know I’m here! Just please don’t leave me!” My words are frantic on her trips to drop me back off. Wanting to say the one right thing that will convince her to let me stay with her. But I can never find it. In my moment of desperation, even though it has never worked, I think that if I repeat this enough she just might be persuaded.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes she convinces me to leave the van on my own. These were rare occasions. “Are you ever coming back?” I ask earnestly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know Kelly. I just don’t know. I’m so unhappy,” is her usual response.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The times she rips me from the van, I chase her down the gravel driveway choking on tears as I beg her not to leave me. I have one focus: getting to Mom. It is survival, and my mind can’t see past this. I am desperate and searching for whatever means possible to get to her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes I chase her down County Road 384, all the way past the dump, until her van disappears. But usually I just return to the trailer where I proceed to call her cellphone on repeat. If she answers, I continue begging “Please Mom! Please let me come with you! I promise I will be good! I just want to be with you!” When she declines, I change my tactic: “Will you at least just stay on the phone with me? You don’t have to talk or say anything, just please stay on the phone with me. Don’t leave Mom. Just please. I need you.” This way, we can know we were both safe without having to talk. There’s no way I can overwhelm her if we aren’t even talking. I could be in her “presence” without overwhelming her. She would always say no and hang up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By this time, Dad would have grabbed his beer and disappeared into the woods or his workshop, an old mobile home located in our make yard.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Each time she hung up on me, I lost more control and got more desperate, repeatedly clicking “redial” on the cordless phone. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brothers would groan in annoyance: “Seriously Kelly, why are you still crying? Just stop, you’re being so annoying.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Similar to a wild animal in survival, I could feel my eyes glazing over when raging at them. At times I would  scream until I feared my own vocal cords would split open. “SHUT UP! Leave me alone! I hate you guys! I hate you! I hate you! I HATE YOU!” My voice would grow until my throat hurt. Is this how Mom feels?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;If they pester me, I attack: hitting, scratching, and screaming until someone strong enough yanks my hair or grabs my arm so hard I retreat. My aggressive survival mode is more wild than any animal. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Mom stops answering my repeated phone calls, her voicemail clicks on: “Hi, you have reached Penny Crystal. Please leave your name, number and a detailed message and I will return your call just as soon as I can. Thanks and have a blessed day.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After I fill her voicemail, I pace the trailer and yard, unable to stop myself from crying. Sometimes I wander to the street looking as far as I can, hoping to see her van approaching from the distance. Eventually, I return to the trailer and look over the back of the couch, out the front window, and down the driveway. Not daring to move my eyes until she returns. Everything in me aches and I can’t feel safe until I see her again. If she doesn’t come, I will fall asleep from exhaustion.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I reflect on these repeated memories of abandonment, I remember being so sad, empty and scared. The only thing that felt safe in the entire world was Mom, but no matter what I did or didn’t do, she never wanted me. It’s like those bad dreams when you are running away from something trying to kill you. Except in the dream, no matter how hard you try, you can only move in slow motion, getting more scared and no closer to safety until eventually, the monster, still running full speed, catches you. Mom’s reach was so close that I could almost feel the relief of safety. It was like reaching out to touch her hand and finding out it was a shadow--because each time, she ripped it away, leaving me to be devoured by the monsters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I only remember one time in which she allowed me to stay with her. I remained completely silent in the van as she drove to the beach. Suddenly, I felt safe knowing where she went when she left us behind. She often talked about going to the beach to pray alone, but my mind never made that connection because I was usually overloaded with emotions.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sitting on the blue steps at the top of the bluff, Mom cries so hard I’m not sure if she’s breathing. It is a summer night and the lakeshore breeze wafts through the air. I remain silent, listening to the crash of the Lake Michigan waves. Mom is right, the lake does have a calming effect.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Finally, she talks. Her words and tears aren’t unusual, I hear them daily. This time feels different solely because it is on a trip when she is “leaving” Dad.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I can’t do anything right," her voice shakes and pauses for more tears. “I try so hard and nobody loves me. Your Dad hates me. You kids hate me. No matter what I do, it’s never enough. I mean, I know people say they love me. But nobody really truly loves me. You know?” I don’t know, but I nod in silence, trying to know. “I wish I was dead. I can’t do this anymore.” Her tears continue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I pause to think, wondering what the one right line is that will help her. “That’s not true Mom, lots of people love you. I love you. I do love you Mom. I really do. Isn’t that enough?” My voice is focused. If I can get her calm, she will want to live. Helping her will also prove that I am not too much. If I save her, then she will love me. Then she will see that we don’t need anyone else in the world who makes us unhappy. Just the two of us and whichever siblings promise not to cause trouble can be happy together.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I know you do. But I still can’t do it. It’s too much." She cries even harder.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Did I say something wrong? I wonder.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At nine years old, I am unaware of the skills that I’m developing for talking with someone who is mentally unstable--skills that would be honed many years later as a social worker for at-risk children and adults. But at this time, it’s survival.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I need you Mom. And you do so many things right. You take care of us kids and teach us our school. You are a lot better than Dad and I would want to be with you over him anytime.” Being better than Dad will certainly lift her spirits. I know it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Really Kelly, you mean that?” She sits taller and hope forms in her voice. My words are working.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I hate Dad. We all hate Dad. He’s mean," I continue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re right.” She pauses to think and her eyes become distant, staring off. “I don’t know why he’s like that.” Then, her head drops with sorrow. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Uncertain what to say, I snuggle her for a hug while thinking of something that might make her laugh. She fastens her arms around me while continuing to cry. I will probably find a past story where we make fun of someone so hard that we laugh until we cry. But the story doesn’t matter. Whatever it takes to remain here in her arms, safe from the world. That’s what matters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once she was cheered up, she would say, “Oh Kelly, thank you for cheering me up. You’re my special girl and I don’t know what I would do without you. You know that? You really do love me.” It’s all of the words I labor to hear. Right here, the foundation of my worth being based on what I can do for others was solidifying. 										

										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>

										&emsp;&emsp;One time, Mom actually took all of us kids with her when she ran away from home after a particularly bad fight with Dad. I remember it being nighttime when she gathered us into the van. As she drove us down County Road 384, I was uncertain if we would ever see the trailer again. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall riding through the ghostly town in silence, only talking to calm Mom when she began to cry again. Occasionally, one of us grunted at the other for being crammed too closely in the seats. But, eventually, we stopped at a fast food joint and Mom ordered each of us a sandwich from the “dollar menu”. She parked at a rundown motel down the street so that we could eat our roast beef sandwiches in silence. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It was late into the night and we were all exhausted, so Mom headed into the motel to get us a room. When she returned, she plopped her head on the steering wheel and sobbed. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t have enough money, and they won’t let us stay. I told them that I have kids but they wouldn’t let us." Her voice trembled with hopelessness. “I guess we are going to sleep in here for tonight.” So, eight of us snuggled in to sleep as best we could in the overcrowded van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know how the others felt at these times, but to me, it seemed as real as the impending apocalypse. It seemed that we were now embarking on a life without Dad and leaving everything we knew behind. One would think that I would see these impulsive acts as patterns of dysfunction from a mentally unstable person, but as a trusting child, I thought: this is it, we are never returning. I also lacked the knowledge of the amount of support and resources it takes for a single mom to leave an abusive relationship. I fell asleep, propped up against Sarah’s small body, with the certainty that I’d never see my home, pets or father again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When the sun lifted above the town, Mom knew Dad had left for work so she drove us home. Life would go on as normal. “God doesn’t believe in divorce. As a woman, I need to honor and respect your father. God would want me to forgive.” Whenever she said this, I was never sure if she was trying to convince us or herself.

									<h2><i>Egg Yolk and Blood</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad built our chicken coop with plywood and hex netting just beside a pond in the backyard. Because we never cleaned the coop, a thick coating of chicken droppings covered the ground inside, creating a foul stench of manure and swamp. Eventually, a build-up of excrement prevented the door from closing properly which allowed the chickens to escape with regularity. One day after I poured chicken feed into the trough, a rooster charged me and as I sprinted for the trailer, the chicken coop door snapped shut behind me--except because the door didn’t fully shut, the rooster was able to slip through and continue his charge. I swatted the food bucket aimlessly behind me and when I heard him moving in on me, I went for one last whack at him before reaching the trailer. He lurched through the air, landing on my back. When he slid off, his claws left a six-inch scratch gushing blood down my calf.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know if my dislike for chickens began following this incident, or the time when I found two of them dead with hundreds of maggots crawling from their bodies. Not only were the chickens uncompromising, but they were disgusting to me. Of all our pets, why did we have chickens? They woke us up way too early in the morning, didn’t snuggle and wanted nothing to do with us. Even so, my daily chore was caring for them.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One morning, I shivered my way across the frost-covered ground for the morning egg collection. Inside the chicken coop were four square roosting boxes filled with small mounds of hay. There were so many eggs laid that morning that when my plastic Neapolitan ice cream bucket was filled and there were still more to collect, I wondered if I had forgotten to do my chore the day prior. I paused to think of an easy solution. I could return to the house for another bucket, but that’s a long walk, so I searched the area for a similar container. Nothing. Determined to complete the task in one trip, I stack the extra ones on top.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Walking ever so carefully with the overflowing bucket of eggs, I eventually reached the kitchen refrigerator. Slowly, I moved a hand from the bucket to open the fridge. My breath caught as I watched a small white egg tumble and splatter onto the floor. From across the room, Dad witnessed the accident. My shame response was immediate: I’m so stupid. I knew I needed to make two trips, but I did not do that because I’m lazy. Gosh, I’m so stupid. Even at the young age of seven years old, Dad’s harsh narrative about me was engraved in my mind and had become my own internal dialogue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I stood frozen in terror as he approached with a tight jaw and eyes that could destroy. He towered over me in anger. 
													<br>
													&emsp;&emsp;“You think it’s okay to drop eggs on my kitchen floor? You’re so lazy and stupid that you couldn’t use your brain to think for just a second! Huh? What are you, a retard?” His voice is mocking, but I’m too scared to listen so it becomes distant, as if coming through a thick fog. My face burns with humiliation and my throat stretches tight. I need to cry, but I don’t dare do it. Then, I hear his voice again. “You’re going to waste eggs?! I’ll show you not to waste eggs!” He grabs an egg from the bucket I’m still holding and smashes on top of my head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He snatches the bucket from my hands, shoves me, and commands “Now go take a shower!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I rush to the shower, unable to breathe from holding too many tears in. No, maybe it’s from holding too much fear in. Or, is it anger? I suppose maybe a bit of everything.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After I close the bathroom door, I release what I can in silent sobs. My chest is heavy with bricks and it’s impossible for air to enter. Each forced breath comes with more shaky, heavy and overwhelming tears. No matter how much I rinse and wash, my hair still feels coated in goopy egg yolk. I am left to figure out another problem with nobody around to guide me. When experiencing a traumatic event, the body's nervous system will commonly respond in one of four ways: by fighting the threat, freezing,  running away or a fawn response, in which the victim attempts to please an abuser to avoid conflict. My brain and body knew the safest option with dad was to freeze, but the threat would never truly be gone until I could disappear from his presence.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, I give up on my hair and collapse onto the floor of the tub, my limbs weak from trembling in fear.  Finally, at the end of the shower I regain my mental strength and think: I may be stupid, but at least now I know the secret ingredient to the world’s softest and shiniest hair. Somehow, I was creating a coping mechanism of finding the positive in even the most humiliating of circumstances.

										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;Not all of my experiences with Dad were painful. Mom always said that he did well with babies and younger kids. Once we got older, she explained, he didn’t know how to get along with us. Around the age of six, Dad and I had a connection. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Most mornings, upon waking, I heard the 1970s mellow song “I Feel the Earth Move” by Carole King coming from his record player. It was my favorite. Still dark outside, everyone would have still been sleeping but they wouldn’t have been asleep for long, as most days my siblings were up until the late hours of the night and did not wake until well into the afternoon.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I typically avoided the kitchen. It was where the mice scampered across the stove, through the pantry, and under the fridge. Sometimes they were found dead in the dirty dishes, unable to escape from the sink. Or, on one occasion, the inside of a pop can. But mornings with Dad made me untouchable to the mice. Being on his good side in those moments meant that his rage would be directed toward anything in the world but me. His aggression would be used to protect, not harm me. Is that how mom felt?
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;He had a tenderness about him--a softness that I only ever saw him have toward his own mother. Sometimes he discussed his music or army days but mostly, we enjoyed each other's presence in silence. Each morning he boiled a pot of water and added two cheap packages of chicken ramen noodles. As the noodles softened, he threw in slices from a brick of Velveeta cheese. I watched him intently, soaking up the enjoyment of him cooking me breakfast. At the table, he poured milk, which stained his light brown mustaches white as he sipped between bites. He flashed occasional smiles in my direction, not needing words to show he enjoyed my presence.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;After breakfast, he sat at the table lacing his steel-toe Timberland boots, wrapping the string around the boots multiple times.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Alright Kelly-girl, let’s get you back to bed.” It was still 5:30am and Mom would be asleep for a few more hours. When left awake, I inevitably got bored and woke my siblings. He knew that the best option for getting me back to sleep was with a quick goodbye kiss and leaving me to snuggle with Mom. Everything felt safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On the weekends, Dad let me spend more time with him. Saturday mornings we headed to the town dump just a quarter mile down County Road 384. We unloaded trash cans from the back of his truck into big metal containers. On days when the bins were full, big trucks came to empty them out. Life was chaotic, but the engines roaring and clanking noises from the dump on Saturday mornings were consistent.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But the dump wasn’t only for dropping off trash, it was also for finding treasures. K.J. 's wife, Martha, tells a traumatizing story of when Mom made her dinner at the trailer. Cramped at the kitchen table, she was in the middle of her meal when Mom exclaimed “Isn’t this turkey great! I found it down the street at the dump and just couldn’t believe that someone was throwing a whole turkey away!” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Martha finishes the story by asserting an uncomfortable “Uh, okay… not eating her food again.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I usually respond to such stories with an embarrassed eye roll and something like: “Ya, Gross. She’s crazy.” Thinking back, this makes me wonder how many of our meals came from the town dump. I laugh as these thoughts come, picturing Mom’s voice saying, “It's ok, It will just build your immune system.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Aside from dumping trash, Dad did other “manly” duties like yard work, hunting, or fixing machines. I enjoyed the rare occasion that he let me tag along when working on his truck at a friend's garage. It was quiet and he brought good food, like Subway sandwiches, for lunch. He enjoyed the calm and quiet with nothing more than the light sound of his radio streaming late 90s country music from the far end of the garage. Occasionally, he asked for a tool or told me about what he was doing.  But mostly, he became irritable when I talked so I watched in silence, learning to enjoy the stillness. I developed this skill so well that for many years, I became mute at the mere sign of male presence. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My favorite experiences with Dad were trips into our woods to cut firewood. He mostly did this in the fall so we wore orange hats and jackets, just in case any deer hunters had snuck onto our property. The roar of his chainsaw was loud, but I didn’t mind because the sweet smell of the freshly cut trees made up for it. I stared in astonishment as powdered tree shavings piled onto the ground, wondering how a machine so small could have enough power to cut an entire tree. Dad gave me instructions on where to stand and sit, which was usually in the back of the truck. He wanted to be sure that I was safe from any trees falling my way. I loved that Dad noticed such things and was diligent about keeping me safe. I followed every instruction, showing him how good I could be. Longing for him to be proud. Hoping to be perfect enough to never again trigger his anger.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes the trees needed a push to go in the right direction. “Tiiimmmbbbbeeeerrr!!!” Dad would shout through a laugh, then smile at me to share the enjoyment.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was in awe of him. He was smart and took the time to teach me things. One day, he went on a tangent about army days and how “you survive on what you can”.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, look here! Take some of these!” I looked at him curiously as he placed little red berries into my hand. Their colors were vibrant and they had a perfectly smooth roundness. I am certain he said the name of them, but the memory has slipped away from me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look, try one!” he popped a handful into his mouth. “If you are ever stuck in the wilderness you need to know what is safe to eat, it’s these here, you can tell by the leaf!” He continued on his explanation, excited that I was interested.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I ate them, I realized they didn’t have much flavor. It kind of reminded me of dull cardboard. And the texture was strange, they crumbled more than smooshed in my mouth. Regardless, I spent years playing imagination games where I was surviving off of little red berries in the wilderness.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Dad was done with the chainsaw, he placed big logs onto the tree stump and cut them smaller with an axe. From there, I was finally able to make myself useful by carrying pieces, one log at a time, to the truck. Being sure to stack them in the very specific rows that he had taught me. It was my special time with him and I felt extra proud when he trusted me to help. For those moments, I truly was daddy’s little girl. But moments were all they were. We would return to the trailer, his irritability would return and anyone might fall victim to his horrendous abuse. Even me.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Touching the Carpet” was my favorite childhood game. The object was to get from one destination to another without touching the carpet, which was lava. One day, when I was around the age of seven, Abe, Sarah, and I made the goal of getting from the boys' bedroom at one end of the trailer, to the kitchen located just after the hall and living room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I set to making my game plan. The hall would be the most difficult challenge, so I search the area, then collect toys and shoes that I can drop and step on as I go. Once I reach the living room, I will be out of supplies. “That’s okay, I’ll use the furniture!” I continue planning.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Except the living room furniture is more difficult to navigate than anticipated. I pause to think, knowing that I need a new plan. Ah, I’ll just follow Abe! I won’t come in first, but I won’t be last either!
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my right, Sarah moves along the couch, not noticing that there will be nothing to climb onto once she reaches the end. Abe heads for the chest of drawers, our peculiar television stand. After that obstacle, it will be a straight shot to the kitchen.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Climbing the chest of drawers is harder than I thought so I use Abe’s tactic of pulling the drawers open and hoisting myself up. My toes balance on top of the dresser and heels hang off the edge. I would have taken a different route had I known how little space was up here. As my feet slide toward the other end, my balance slips. When my left hand struggles to grasp the tv, the right goes for a metal object beside it--a TV aerial mounted onto the wall. Dad usually keeps it outside on the roof but for whatever reason, it is inside at this time. It doesn’t hold my weight, but it does provide what I need to regain balance. Abe has already made it back down and as I steady myself, the aerial falls, piercing the top of his head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The game is over. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I climb down the drawers and to his side. Blood is gushing from his puncture wound, his dark blonde hair is soaked with it. Mom suddenly appears from her bedroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh no! What happened!” she exclaims.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It was an accident. We were playing no touching carpet and the antenna fell. It was just an accident.” My voice is rushed, trying to emphasize that I did not hurt him intentionally.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kurt! I need you! Come help, quick!” Mom screams and runs to Abe’s side.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I stumble backwards, afraid of what Dad’s reaction will be.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He rushes from his bedroom, bringing the stench of beer with him. Rather than tending to the gaping wound, he turns his attention to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Dammit Kelly! Why would you drop the antenna on his head like that for?!” His hands grasp my arm and shove me down face first onto the couch. I’m held frozen while he unlatches his leather belt. My limbs flail in efforts to escape as they anticipate the sting of the blow. The first one lands and my teeth clench. I yelp with the next one. And comes another. And another. The snap of the leather striking my bottom is excruciating. The sting worsens when he misses and thrashes my thighs or calves. Or worse, my back. Fear and pain overtake me, and I can no longer breathe through my clenched chest. I lose track of how many times he whips me, hoping each one will be the last. Everything hurts. I want him to understand that it was an accident. That I would never hurt Abe on purpose. I want him to know that I try hard to be a good kid. Instead, I’m left with the  hopelessness of  knowing that I can’t escape being in trouble. I can’t escape the pain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Now get to your room and don’t come out until I say you can!” he shouts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Muscle memory guides me to the back bedroom. I can’t see through the tears. It’s the bedroom that would later become the boys’ room, but for now, it sleeps me, Abe, Chase, Sarah, Josiah, and Dylan. My bed is one of the small triple bunks that Dad had built onto the wall, but because I usually sleep on the couch or with Mom, it is filled with boxes of toys, clothes, and old blankets. Between not having a bed, and still not having permission to leave the room, I head for an open bunk bed at the other end of the room to fulfill my punishment. Who knows how long I will be in here. Sometimes Mom and Dad forget. When that happens, I call a sibling to the room, begging them to ask that I be let out. Other times, I wait for Dad to leave, then come out. But today, I imagine I will remain in this room until the next morning. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My legs and bottom are swollen, but numb. A child who knows abuse, knows that there is a point beyond the pain where there is no feeling. Instead, I work to regain my breath because air won’t fit through my chest. And my limbs shake with terror.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Still crying uncontrollably, I peek out the door, hoping that Mom will see and comfort me. Instead, I see Dad with his green metal army box that he keeps medical supplies in. Abe sits at the table crying while Dad works on his head. He is grunting about having to give him “stitches.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I close the door and return to the top bunk. My legs throb now. My bottom begins to sting. The ache in my head, throat, and chest make it impossible to stop crying. My mind conjures up images of  Mom hugging me until I can get calm again. She would tell me that it wasn’t my fault and that she knew it was an accident. It would be followed by her apologizing for Dad being mean to me. But Dad would never know. That’s what she usually did. But on this night, when I need it most, no one comes. I curl into a ball until the tears rock me to sleep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;That night would create a family story that always began with “remember that time when Kelly cracked Abe’s head open?” Everyone would laugh and breathe sighs of relief that he was okay while he touched his scar in remembrance. No one acknowledged that it wasn’t intentional. No one recalled the beating I received from playing a silly game. Such whippings were never mentioned because all of us children suffered so many--and for reasons far more unjust.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was like the dogs when they did something triggering such immense anger in Dad that he attacked them. When he finished, they whimpered, limped, made themselves small, and hid. None of us were brave enough to acknowledge the injustice and comfort them. The moment it was over, we coped by pretending it never existed at all.

									<h3>
										Animals III - German Shepherds
									</h3>
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;We always owned at least one purebred German Shepherd. “These are guard dogs. They will protect you and take down any bad guy who tries to hurt you," Dad assured us regularly.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;He launched into a story to prove his point. One of  Dad’s friends commented on the nice temperament of our dog, Buck. “I told him that Buck was a guard dog and would protect anyone who lives here if someone tried to hurt us but he didn’t believe me. So I said, ‘you pretend to attack me and I guarantee he will protect me,’” Dad’s voice was loud and harsh with a mocking tone. It was the tone that he used to show that someone was, as he would say, a “retard”.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;“Sure enough, he put his arms up like he was going to hurt me and Buck put a hole right into his stomach.” By this part of the story, his hoarse smoker's voice was laughing with satisfaction. He had proven his point.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Given how much Dad beat the dogs, I didn’t understand why they protected him. He raged on the gentle creatures for simple things like getting in his way, eating out of the trash, or having a rare potty accident in the house. His method of training was to attack and show them who was in control. “That is how you earn their respect," Dad explained to us. But what I saw was a lack of control all around. Something would snap in Dad. His eyes became dark and before anyone could blink, the dogs would be pinned down, choked, and beaten. Their pitiful whimpers didn’t stop him. He only released when the rage passed. The moment he did, they cowered, wet themselves, and hid, just like us kids. Dad would then move on as if nothing had happened, often looking confused as to why people and animals feared him.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;The dog's loyalty compared to Mom’s never-ending forgiveness of Dad. Whether they protected him in hopes of earning his respect or out of fear--or because they genuinely loved him--was uncertain. Maybe it was a mixture of all. My guess is that it was survival. Follow the instruction to avoid the abuse.

											</p>
											~ 
											<p><br>
											
											&emsp;&emsp;Our dogs died for numerous reasons. The first one, Sasha, had been one of my favorites. Dad had been struggling to get along with our neighbors which was not uncommon, as his temper impacted many of his relationships. One night he burst through the back door. He was furious. Attempting to control his emotions, he rubbed his hand through his brown curly hair while pacing the living room. 
												<br>
												&emsp;&emsp;“The dog’s dead. That retard neighbor poisoned her. I found her lying dead on that side of the house.” He pointed toward the direction of his and Mom’s bedroom.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;My body shook as I attempted to wrap my mind around how the dog was dead and worse, that she had been poisoned! I did not know if I was more afraid of the dog's death, Dad’s anger, or the neighbor who he was convinced had killed her. Whatever the cause, it was to my dismay that Sasha had indeed been found dead outside.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;She was replaced with another German Shepherd dog, Lady, who later birthed purebred puppies. Being the runt of the litter, our new family favorite pup, Max, appeared much smaller than any German Shepherd I had ever seen. Intelligence made up for his small stature, making him a wonderfully calm and well-trained pet. Most of my family avoided the animals, as they all had serious infestations of fleas. I figured that the house was infested anyway, so I didn’t see the difference. Snuggling with him on the floor became my favorite pastime. Besides, the flea bites left only small red marks on my body, unlike Mom, who they seemed to torture relentlessly.
												<br>
												&emsp;&emsp;One day, Max was hit by a car, leaving his back leg broken. Searching for a solution, Dad headed to Menard’s, the local hardware store, to buy materials for making a cast. Max appeared miserable attempting to walk with a bulky homemade cast on his leg.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Efforts to heal it with a cast failed, as Max inevitably found ways to chew it off. “That’s it, he can’t continue living in pain like this.” Irritated, Dad went to his safe and retrieved a gun.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Sarah and I concocted a solution. Vet expenses were too high, but what about a cone to stop him from chewing the cast? Neither of us mustered the bravery to share our ideas with Dad.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;“Stay inside, I have to go take care of Max.” Dad hurried through the living room with his pistol.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t dare move.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Staring at the door from the living room, time froze when the gunshot rang through the air.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;By the time I gathered the nerve to go outside, Dad was moving Max, who was wearing a plastic grocery bag over his head. “If you get them right in the temple it is a quick death. They die before they even know what has happened," Dad attempted to reassure us. Puddles of blood bubbled in the dirt. 
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;In some ways, knowing his death was quick did provide reassurance. In other ways, I grappled with another meaningless death due to my parents’ failure to take care of their pets’ basic needs. Some creatures, it seems, aren’t worthy of protecting--no matter how loved or loyal they are. I would soon learn to never take a moment with loved ones for granted, while the fear of what might happen without their presence settled in my soul’s core.

									<h2><i>Grandma Reed</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Holidays were another reminder of how different our family was from the rest of the world. Halloween was satanic, so evil that I genuinely feared it. Not celebrating a holiday with pagan roots made sense in some of our church circles. But not celebrating Christian holidays like Easter and Christmas solicited strange looks--even from our conservative community. Mom thought that Easter idolized the bunny too much, rather than focusing on the Resurrection. She explained that we didn’t celebrate Christmas because of its pagan roots. “Besides,” she would say, “we don’t truly even know when Jesus was born anyway.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know if I felt more embarrassed or confused about not partaking in the typical children’s activities such as shopping for gifts, dying Easter Eggs, or getting pictures with Santa. We didn’t even attend Sunday services on days when Easter or Christmas sermons were planned. On rare occasions, I talked Mom into letting me attend Kibby Church’s Wednesday night youth group. But she only agreed because I promised that I wouldn’t partake in anything related to the Easter Bunny or Christmas.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Keeping my promise while participating with my friends required creativity. When we decorated Christmas cookies, I chose the snowman one. “It resembles winter, not Christmas," I assured Mom. If we did an art activity, I made mine about snowflakes. Easter was more difficult and I found myself sitting out of many Easter egg hunts. Fortunately, my friends were patient with me, sharing candy of their own.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So, why don’t you celebrate Jesus’ birth or resurrection?” They were genuinely as confused as I was.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know, my Mom just thinks they are satanic or something like that. I don’t know, she’s weird like that.” Each time someone asked, my jaw tightened and blood flooded my cheeks. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad disagreed with Mom on Christmas. And although her views were strong, she was more afraid of Dad. So when he took us to Grandma Reeds’ home each Christmas, she stayed silent.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he could afford it, he even bought us gifts of his own. Before going to Grandma Reed’ we enthusiastically unwrapped new sleds, board games, and clothing. “Remember, we don’t celebrate Christmas. This is just something nice that your dad wanted to do for you," Mom reminded us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But the gifts were often followed by Dad’s “Merry Christmas, you guys!” His smile was genuine on days when visiting Grandma was in our schedule. He adored her like no one else.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But, Mom didn’t like Grandma Reed. “She acts like she is better than everyone else,” she’d complain. “And we always have to go visit her. She can never drive thirty minutes to see her own grandkids. If she cares about you guys, she will have to come here to visit.” Because of this, we saw her twice a year: at my Uncle Chad’s on Thanksgiving and a month later at her house on Christmas Day. Mom rarely came to her Christmas celebrations. Instead, she passed up yet another opportunity of spending time with her kids to be alone in prayer. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t understand Mom’s dislike for Grandma Reed because I loved her just as dearly as Dad did. Each year when we arrived, she greeted us with big smiles, hugs and kisses. When she made it to me she would squeeze my cheeks and exclaim “you still have those beautiful dimples!” The pinching hurt, but it didn’t matter because it was Grandma.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My father’s father, Grandpa Crystal, died many years before I was born. What little I know about him was from Mom. “He was not a nice man. I really think he was pretty physically abusive to your dad and his brothers," she would explain with pity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometime after he died, Grandma married Grandpa Reed. Mom didn’t like him either. “He doesn’t like kids and is just rude," she would mutter every time we went over there. I felt confused by this because as a young girl, I felt perfectly comfortable around him.

										&emsp;&emsp;After his death, we were never allowed into Grandma’s basement again but I was never sure why. I always wondered if that was where she kept his special belongings. Instead, we spent the holiday in her living room. Her house was outdated. The furniture and appliances looked like they hadn’t been changed out since the 1960s or 1970s. Yet somehow, they were so well maintained that they still looked new. The warm home smelled of green bean casserole, bread rolls, and my favorite, baked beans. Knowing how many I would eat, Grandma always made extra. I would eat firsts, seconds, thirds, and even fourths on baked beans. Even with my stuffed tummy, she would continue piling more servings on my plate. “You’re not full already, are you?! I made extra knowin
