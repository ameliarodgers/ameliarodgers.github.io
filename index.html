										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The brain has an incredible ability to heal and change throughout its lifespan. Everyone brings a unique set of individual strengths to this life. My hope is that my writing will assist individuals throughout their own healing process and provide tools for those walking alongside others who share similar experiences to mine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I grew up in Southwest Michigan and moved to Grand Rapids in 2012 to continue my education in social work. My hobbies include spending time with loved ones, enjoying the outdoors, writing, reading, and making memories with my dog, Arya. My perfect day includes time spent in meaningful conversations and sharing many laughs with close friends. I believe that our closest connections are what build resiliency and strength as we navigate the joys and hardships of life.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This writing will include many details relating to physical, sexual, mental, and emotional abuse. If trauma stories such as this are something that might trigger you, I encourage you to do what is best for yourself even if that means refraining from reading this blog or moving at a pace that works well for you. If you are someone who finds such topics helpful in your own life then grab a blanket, cozy up, and join me during this chapter of my journey.
										<br><br>
										Much Love,
										<br>

									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Barely tall enough to peer over the top of the mattress, I stand at the foot of my parents’ bed. Crammed into the back room of our tiny mobile home, the bed and dressers leave little space for movement. Evening is setting in and the sun gleams through the window, leaping off the back of the figure in front of me. It is a man. Sitting tall and colossal, he speaks to me. Glancing up curiously, I wonder why he has brought me here. I am only four  years old, and it is all so bewildering to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>Where were my parents?</i> I ask now. True to character, Dad must have been downing drinks at the corner tavern. And Mom must have been at church, or more likely, socializing with another man for attention. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You do this and just put your mouth on it," the strange man educates steadily, as if to teach me something valuable. My brain has reduced his face to that of a shadow being engulfed by the gazing sun. What I know for certain is that the man in the memory is not my older brother, Josiah. My first perpetrator is not the one whom my childhood self would soon know as my full-time abuser. This man was different, older, taller, yet a person whom I must have known well at the time. Eyes shifting down to the long body part in front of my face, I squint in confusion, feeling uncertain while continuing as instructed. This is my very first memory. Innocence stolen so young that I will never know what life prior to abuse was like. The trauma memories would remain trapped in the body for years to come, attempting escape through murmurs so indistinct that their silent echos would remain buried.

									<h2><i>Illusion</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was born and raised in a pleasant beach town called West Haven, and I truly wish my life’s story reflected the beauty of its majestic dunes, birch trees, and gentle waters. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Situated just below Canada and shaped like a mitten, Michigan is known for its grueling winters: freezing temperatures, heavy snowfalls, and dark skies. But by the month of June, warm summer breezes shift the skies from gloomy to pleasant, and the ghost town of West Haven becomes a resort town bustling with tourists who enjoy the quaint shopping district, high-end seasonal restaurants and long sandy beaches of Lake Michigan. Some say that on a clear day, the Chicago skyscrapers can be seen from across the lake, others argue that is just an illusion--for the Windy City is a full one hundred miles across the freshwater lake.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The lake bluffs are filled with million dollar vacation homes owned largely by people from Illinois, whom locals refer to as FIPs, “Fucking Illinois People”. Although the visitors keep the town financially afloat, warm months come with too many people crammed into a small space and it feels suffocating to me. As the season ends and the town empties, the low income residents like my family go back to living their hard-scrabble lives and scraping by with limited resources. The wealth of the area is an illusion for us too.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Many say that even with this duplicity, I am lucky to grow up in such a picturesque place. In some ways, I agree. But in others, I contemplate what being born in a different location, with an entirely different family, might have been like for me. Had I grown up in a nurturing environment with love, acceptance, and structure, would I be the person I am today? Would I be something greater? Or worse? Would I even wonder about this? These are questions which I will never know the answer to because I wasn’t raised in a safe, caring home. Far from it. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Just two miles from the beach, West Haven quickly transitions into the countryside which is where Dad bought fifty acres of deer hunting land many years prior to my birth. On this swampy, flat land was a mobile home trailer that housed nine children, two adults, and entirely too many animals over the next twenty years.  And, for the longest time, the memories of the land and its people were lost to me, but once I recalled it all, I knew I must share it all.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;On February 20, 1994, I was born in the small white trailer with brown shutters located on County Road 384. After many hospital births, Mom felt God calling her away from worldly Western medicine. It was a Sunday morning and her midwife, Marian, helped deliver me in my parents’ bed.  There would be no medical intervention for labor--not even a simple aspirin--for this was deemed unholy. Like all of the women in Mom’s evangelical Christian community, Marian didn’t cut her hair because it was immodest and worldly to look anything but a proper female, pure as the Virgin Mary. Her dark brown tresses grew well past her waist, but would have been pulled back into a single, tightly woven, French braid for “women’s work” such as this. Her face was always calm, unadulterated, and supported by a peaceful character. I imagine she and Mom sharing tears that night as they realized that after five boys, Mom had finally birthed the daughter that she spent so many years praying for.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At only nineteen years old, just months after my parents married, Mom birthed my eldest brother, James. A few years later came Jason, then another gap before she had Josiah. After that, Mom gave birth every two years to: Chase, Abe, and then me. Once I came along, Mom decided that God trusted her to have as many offspring as she could.  Thus came Sarah, Daniel, and then at age forty, her final child, Avalon. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We don’t have many photos of all eleven of us together because by the time the last two came around, the first two had already moved out of the trailer. Our best family photo was before Avalon’s birth--and Mom was beyond excited. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Here Kelly, put on this dress!” she hurriedly instructed after tying my wavy blond hair back with a lace bow. She had made a special trip to Walmart for the dress. It was pretty, laced, and in my favorite color, light pink. After some shouting, complaining, and spit-shining, the ten of us piled into our twelve passenger church van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The wait outside of the “Walmart Portrait Studio” was a long one for the ten of us. We had to stay clean, groomed and well-behaved for what seemed like hours. Legs aching from waiting in line, our turn finally arrived. Mom’s enthusiasm was shared by Dad as we rushed to gather for our picture. Unexpectedly, things became tense. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You can’t turn us away! We came all this way to have our picture taken!” Dad yelled at the photographer. You see, there are things that we forget to take into consideration with big families, one of them being the fact that we might not all fit into a discount store’s little photo room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was able to tune out the harshness of Dad’s voice by focusing on my aching legs, itchy dress, and dolls waiting at home. Tension continued to build in the air as the shouting continued, then we abruptly returned to our van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once home, desperate to help Mom get her family picture, Dad set up his camera in our front yard. “You, sit here!” Dad commanded. “And you, stand here,” he directed my older brothers. The camera timer was set, and I squinted a half smile into the bright sun, anxious for the event to be over. We stood at attention: Dad in his best church shirt from JC Penney’s and cleanest jeans, Mom in her hand-sewn prairie dress that draped to the ground, and the nine children with at-home haircuts and traditional, modest clothes. 3, 2, 1 and there it was: a snapshot of the Cole's in front of the pine trees in all our finest. Looking happy. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But, I could not shake the sadness inside of me about Mom not getting the professional photos she hoped for. It was the first time my chest and stomach felt the aching need to take care of her, a feeling that stayed with me for years to come.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;Months later, the time grew closer for our family to welcome Avalon into this world. The seasons were changing, winter struggling to decide if it was ready to let spring in. The air was cold, barely warm enough for rain to wash away the snow. Throughout Mom’s pregnancy I travelled with her to a small town, Paw Paw, for monthly checkups with Marian. I noticed with curiosity that this town had poles dotting the city streets. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It is a parking meter,” Mom explained, gently teaching me something new. “Here, take a quarter and put it in right there." Feeling excited, I slid the silver into the slot. There were times when I was quite young when I was filled with Mom’s warmth.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I played with baby dolls while waiting for Mom to finish her appointment.  When Marian and Mom joined me in the waiting room, they continued to discuss birthing plans, but it was all foreign to me. No one had explained to me what pregnancy or birth was. What I did know was that Mom’s belly was growing and there was a baby inside that would somehow eventually be outside and that would be my new brother or sister. But <i>how</i>? And <i>why</i>? I did not understand. Based on their deliberate tones, something big was coming. My body became jittery with uncertainty.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Looking up, I observed how big her belly was through her long button-up dress. “There’s a real baby in there?” I asked anxiously.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“There is!” Mom exclaimed then returned to her conversation. My face tensed as I continued to anticipate what was to come--but like so many other times in my life, I was left in the dark. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Mom went into labor a few nights later, I feared something seriously bad was happening. I sat in my nightgown on the couch watching her attentively. She was walking from the kitchen to the living room when she suddenly hunched over and breathed through heavy pain. Her body was an outline, barely visible by the light from above the kitchen sink. She stood up and took another step before collapsing into the shelf that Dad’s record player sat on. I approached her cautiously, wanting to hug her but knowing that I shouldn’t touch her. 
											 <br>
											 &emsp;&emsp;“Oh, yup, I think I’m in labor. And my water broke,” her words pushed through clenched teeth as she clung to the wall beside her. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Immediately, I wished that she was not having a baby. Seeing her in such pain was unbearable.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Get your shoes and coats. You are going to Aunt Katie’s for the night," Dad instructed. Everyone around me appeared frantic and jittery. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please, just let me stay home! I promise that I will be good. I don’t want to be away from Mom!” I pleaded through tears. <i>What if something bad happens to her while I’m gone?</i> Worry settled in. At only six years old, the fear of being abandoned was yoked to me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At Aunt Katie and Uncle Ryan’s, my heavy-chested tears remained uncontrollable. Still in my nightgown, I stood in their kitchen begging to go home. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I want Mom,” I sobbed. The acrid smell of my aunt’s hair salon wafted from the basement and my long hair stuck to the tears on my cheeks. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I want Mom. I want Mom," the words sputtered out repeatedly--emotions so unruly that plans were made, and I was brought home in the middle of the night. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sitting in the dark, quiet, and cluttered living room, I watched a war movie with Dad. My body was calm and at peace as I felt Mom’s presence from her bedroom. The terror of the birth over, I was, for now, safe.

									<h2><i>Left Behind</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;There is something profound about the intensity of certain dreams. Mom would describe my night terrors as “visions from God”--a way of Him communicating to us something that would happen in the future. As a child with deep love and admiration for her, I soaked up Mom’s words and believed this mindset. But, my childhood nightmares came strong and often--and if God was trying to tell me something, it was that I was doomed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>My body jerks awake, trembling in fear. Evil looms in the air. As eyes adjust to the dark, shadows make themselves known. They are not people, but clothes strewn on the couch, floor, and bed where my siblings and parents once slept. I am left in this world alone. Lost without the people who I love and need the most.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The clock across the room reads 8:30am. Darkness fills the sky in defiance of the morning. Similar to Left Behind, Tribulation, Revelation and other apocalypse movies that I watch regularly, the rapture has come. Panicking, I burst out the backdoor of the trailer, dashing down the street to my homeschool friend, Shae’s, house. Straining through the gloom, I know the thirty days of darkness that Mom said would come during the “end times” has arrived.   
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Relief sweeps over me as Shae’s mother, Lana, opens the door.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please! You have to help me! I woke up to find that my…” My words are interrupted  as I notice her right hand. There it is. The small numbers reading “666” tattooed in black ink.  Lana’s eyes are different, darker. The evil is within her. My left hand covers the right in efforts to hide the fact that Satan’s mark does not live on me. Why would God take my family and leave me behind? I wonder. My head throbs and I search my surroundings, desperate to hide away from the evil that suddenly fills the world.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The dream skips ahead. People socialize in the basement the local Christian Reformed Church where Wednesday night youth groups and homeschool gatherings are held. A musty smell from the old chapel building stuffs the air. Standing outside the storage room, I remember Mom standing in her ankle length jean dress copying school work pages. Her long black hair held back with a fluffy bow clip.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;An aching feeling immerses itself into my stomach, chest, and throat as the copy machine hums in the empty closet. Mom isn’t here. It was just a memory, a longing for her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I scan the room and see my homeschool friends and their families mingling, moving on with life as if nothing has changed. Hiding my right hand, I notice that everyone in the room has “666” ingrained into theirs. Suddenly, Lana’s cold eyes reach mine from across the room. She has noticed my naked hand. I am exposed, no longer able to hide. Even in the dream, my choice is certain. I fear corruption more than death. My body shivers as it anticipates choosing death by a guillotine over allowing itself to be consumed by the demonic evil in the world.</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I leap from the dream to a seated position on the couch. Like all other times when I am afraid, every limb of my body shudders with anxiety. I search the living room: Sarah’s four-year-old body is sandwiched against me on the shabby couch. Daniel and Abe are wrapped in blankets sleeping soundly on the toy-filled floor. It is not yet morning and although the nightmare is over, my body trembles as if the experience were real. I scamper to Mom’s bedroom and wake her. Shaky words leave my mouth faster than my brain can process them, explaining my horrific dream.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I sink into her body as she hugs me, knowing that I can never be close enough to fully feel safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh my gosh, Kelly. God has chosen you for this dream. Just like he does with me, he has spoken to you in your sleep. He has shown you a vision of things that are going to happen!” Her voice rises with energy as her certainty in this grows. This is not an abnormal response, as she often shares different dreams of God speaking to her. But this is the first time Mom interprets my dreams as being sent from God.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom believed that me being chosen by God was a gift but I wanted nothing to do with it. If this fear was God’s gift, I would rather not know.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“He must be telling you that the rapture is coming! And when it comes, it will be at 8:30 in the morning, the same time as in your dream!” Her blue eyes glisten with hope. “But Kelly…” her voice drops and her face hangs to defeat. “God must also be telling you that you are going to be left behind, just like you were in the dream." She hugs me in silence as she thinks. I focus on the softness of her cotton nightgown, absorbing the comfort of her smell. “Yes, that’s it. God is telling me that this dream is deeper. It is God telling you that you must have sinned. You need to think really hard about what you might have done to upset him, then change your heart and pray for forgiveness. Here, I will pray for your heart right now. That God will heal you and change you to live in a way that pleases him." I’m already smashed into her body, but she embraces me even tighter, both of us desperate to never let go.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her eyes close as she begins to pray, her words quickly switching from English to unrecognizable gibberish. She is speaking in tongues again. According to Mom, this is her way of accessing God on another level. He is taking over her body and she is speaking to him in his language, but God speaking to me through this dream crushed my little soul. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brain searched for what I must have done to sin against God. <i>Was it because Josiah touched me down there again?</i> I wondered. But I always ask God for forgiveness right after! I reasoned. It settled on, but even before he touches you, you know it is wrong. You have not done enough to stop him from touching you. Yes, that must be the sin. Hopelessness overcame me as I knew that the next time Josiah came for me, my fear of him in that moment would overpower my knowledge of it being a sin and being left behind.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During the following days and weeks, I watched the clock closely at 8:30am every morning waiting in fear for my family to disappear. At six years old, emptiness filled my soul as I knew that there was nothing that I could do to stop the inevitable.

										Animals I - Ducks
									</h3>
									<p>
										<i>
										&emsp;&emsp;One year, for a science experiment, Mom bought eggs to hatch in an incubator. It was a venture that the local high school-aged homeschoolers had taken on, my older brothers included. Watching ducklings hatch was a miracle in itself. I hovered in awe attempting to understand how life was created inside of a small brown egg. How did ducklings live inside the eggs one second and outside the next? That experiment was the only glimpse of science education that I received prior to public school for mom did not want sinful teachings about the earths creation to steer us away from God.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the ducklings grew, I often watched them staying in their line, following their designated “Momma Duck” closely around the yard. It amazed me that animals could be so closely bonded--and had such strong survival skills. They knew that following their mother was safe--and that there was always safety in numbers.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A few months later I returned from a hike in the backwoods when Sarah approached me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly!” There was strain in Sarah’s voice. “The ducks are dead!” she wailed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? What happened?!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“They were hit by a car. A couple lived, but most are gone.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I continued toward the trailer, not sure what to think. In the kitchen I found Mom, attempting to keep up with endless amounts of household chores. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, did the ducks really die?” My voice was shaking. It couldn’t be true. Taking a hesitant breath through clenched teeth, Mom feigned an expression of sympathy, but her voice lacked any genuine concern, 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yup they died. You wouldn’t believe it! They all just followed each other right into the street!” Using her typical coping mechanism of turning painful events into lighthearted moments, she began laughing. “Just one, right after the other! Can you even believe it?!” she chuckled.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I rushed to the road out front , desperate to see for myself. Someone had removed the bodies, but blood and an unimaginable number of white feathers remained, layering County Road 384. My jaw and chest muscles tightened at the horrific scene, aching at the unexpected loss following a deep love connection. Not knowing what to feel, I pushed the sight from my mind. It took a while, but I was able to convince myself that the ducks lived a good life with a pain-free death. This was my own coping mechanism: following horrific events that my family was cruelly indifferent to, I recreated more pleasant outcomes in my mind. The new scenarios helped my tender heart heal.

									<h2><i>Rhett</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;I always wondered if Mom’s zealous evangelical beliefs stemmed from her younger years when she dabbled in what she called “witchcraft”. She and her younger brother, Rhett, experimented with friends when they were in their late teens and early twenties. Mom spoke of this often, mostly discussing the ouija board, crystals, spells, and enchantments. She spoke of “witches” living in West Haven, explaining that they were women who worked in the dark arts. Although she never specified what kind, she feared how these women communicated with, and worshiped, the devil. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Prior to this, she had grown up Catholic. I am uncertain what prompted her turn away from that faith, but by adulthood she hated Catholics. Her religious reasoning was because of their view of the trinity, but I never fully understood the nuances of this objection. She also believed that they “idolized the Virgin Mary” and did not put enough emphasis on God. Her detest for this faith was so strong that if I met someone who attended the local St. Basil's church, she would mutter “Ugh, she’s Catholic. We better not spend any time with their family.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Because of the evangelical church’s inclusive practice regarding “sinners”, I was able to socialize with families composed of addicts, alcoholics, convicts and child abusers, but heaven-forbid I spend time with someone who associated themselves with the Catholic faith. It didn’t make sense to me why Mom judged some people so harshly--or why someone's religious beliefs made them inherently evil. It was all so confusing to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she left Catholicism behind, that seems like a natural breaking away from her childhood, but I sense there must have been a hard shift away from witchcraft; I can only imagine what happened. I picture her as having a welcoming personality and open mind like me, then one day naively partaking in a pagan ritual that frightened her somehow. As a child, I told myself that was why Mom is the way she is: her religious views must have come from a bad experience that scared her into believing in a punishing God. That would make sense why she was so fanatical about her brand of Christianity. But I really don’t know.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall driving through West Haven, there were nearly ten houses that she would gesture to and warn, “A witch lives there. Don’t ever go into that house!”. A mile up the street she would point to another house, “The woman who lives there uses a ouija board and does witchcraft. Stay away from there too." These remarks came with eye rolls and judgmental tones, then she would shift to a tone of confidence. “These are all houses where Rhett and I used to do witchcraft--UNTIL GOD SAVED US!” And her eyes would glow.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Rhett died at a young age, still in his early twenties. Perhaps this was another turning point for Mom. Both she and Grandma Williams had supernatural takes on his death. Every so often throughout my childhood, Mom would wake up and excitedly tell us, “I had a dream about your Uncle Rhett last night! He was dead after being trampled by a horse but then he woke up and started talking to me! It is a vision from God that Rhett is alive and in heaven with him! He must have prayed and gotten saved right before he died!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One time, Mom’s dream went as far as: “Uncle Rhett told me that I will have a kid who will become a pastor! And that kid is Jacob! It’s a sign from the Lord! Oh thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus!” Her eyes were always glowing after such dreams. Her spirit and energy lifted. No sign of the heaviness that she usually carried. This made me uncomfortable. It felt as if she interpreted everything in her life being about God. It was an obsession that took priority over the wellbeing of her kids--something she couldn’t overcome. I didn’t understand why a dream couldn’t just be a dream. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During a time when I lived with Grandma Williams, she shared her viewpoint: “Rhett was always hanging out with those friends who did witchcraft. Finally, he came to me, and said, ‘Mom, I’m done. I can’t do it anymore and have decided to stop hanging out with those friends.’ And he did! Then one day, his friend wanted him to come over and talk. I told Rhett not to go, that he would just get sucked back into it. But he said he wanted to go anyway." Her voice was heavy with regret and disappointment of not trying harder to stop him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Gram’s hair was short and dyed red to cover the grey, and she had a long scar under her chin from when she had surgery to remove extra skin. A golden necklace with an oval trinket always hung from her neck, a gift that Rhett gave her just weeks before his death. She continued, “He was on his way there when the drunk driver hit him. The car caught fire and he was trapped.”  They had to use the “jaws of life” to get him out. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the hospital, they learned that the majority of his body had fourth degree burns. If he lived, his body would remain severely scarred and the healing process would be excruciatingly painful as his nerves healed. Grandma made the tough decision for the doctors to “pull the plug”.  She came to terms with his death by explaining: “I believe that if Rhett had made it to his friend’s house, he would have gotten sucked back into witchcraft. I think that God let him die as a way of saving him from that.” I always felt confused by this response, wondering why a God with such power would choose to kill someone over intervening in some other way.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom developed a similar mindset about life, believing that when good things happened to us, God was rewarding us for good behavior and when hardships came, it was a punishment from not living in a Godly way. She compared it to the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. God tested Abraham’s faith by telling him to sacrifice his own son. Then when he went to kill his son, God spared him because of his strong faith.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Grandma told the story of Rhett, her voice softened and took on a higher pitch, as if trying to fight tears. She would remove a box of his belongings from her guest room closet. Then, putting his clothes to her nose, she cried silent tears. “The cologne is in the box. It all still smells like him.”  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For the remainder of her life, her blue Honda CR-V could be found around town with a bumper sticker that read: “A DRUNK DRIVER KILLED MY SON”.
										
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										

										&emsp;&emsp;As one might expect, the death Rhett significantly affected my grandmother and my mother, but Mom’s reaction was to cling to her evangelical beliefs with a ferocity. Since I could remember, Mom believed that Satan was regularly working to attack her for choosing God over witchcraft. Around the age of six, when I remember my doomsday nightmares starting, Mom shared her own experiences with spiritual warfare. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“When James and Jacob were toddlers, your dad and I separated because he was going behind my back with another woman. One night I was sitting in bed when my bedroom lights started flickering. Then, my bed lifted off the floor and was hovering. Across the room, I saw a demon. I grabbed my bible from my nightstand and prayed. I said, ‘Lord Jesus, I rebuke this demon!’ Then suddenly, my bed went back to the floor and the lights stopped flickering. God protected me! He knew the demons were out to get me but I prayed and trusted God and he saved me! Ever since then, whenever I see a demon I just pray and it goes away because demons are scared of God. Sometimes I think God is testing me by letting the demons near me to see how I will respond.” I would listen with rapt attention to every word. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Regardless of my age, she would animatedly recount her experiences such as this and sometimes she would tell me stories of people who had been possessed and had taken on animal-like characteristics, such as squirming and hissing like a snake. The demon would be in the person's body, but their voice would change and it would talk through them. There was an entire prayer process before it would leave the person. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Usually,” she explained, “the person didn’t remember what had happened”. But when she told the story, I remembered. I always remembered.  When she spoke, I could see in my mind’s eye a man hissing on our living room floor and a pastor casting the demon out. My imagination in hearing this story made the experience real, and I felt chills in every corner of my body. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I showed my fear, she tried reassuring me, “Oh don’t worry, we are protected. Whenever you feel scared, just pray to God and Satan won’t be able to touch you.” But it didn’t work. The fear remained--as if lodged into my body for eternity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It didn’t help that she encouraged me to watch movies, such as <i>The Apocalypse</i>, <i>Tribulation</i> and <i>Left Behind</i>, which taught me about the “end of times” foretold in the Bible and how to identify Satan moving in the world. We must be ever-vigilant for the end of the world is coming and God’s chosen people would disappear in an event called “the rapture”. Those who were left behind would be stuck in a world ruled by Lucifer. These individuals would be forced to either get the “mark of the beast”, Satan’s numbers reading “666”, on their right hand or forehead. If they refused, Lucifer or his followers would kill them. The idea was, if you chose to die for God over following Satan, you would still get to heaven. It would teach me to know when God is testing me and how to stay strong. For years I became fixated with these movies. Memorizing every line and character. If I wanted to be safe from spiritual warfare, I would need to learn the characteristics of the good people in the movies. That is how I would survive. From these movies, I learned that I would always choose good over evil in this world, no matter how hard the fight. But at six years old, I just couldn’t suss out what was evil and what wasn’t.

										Animals II - Pigs and Chickens
										</h3>

										<i>
										<p>
											&emsp;&emsp;At an age so young that it is barely memorable, I bonded with our pigs. The pigpen was located in a fenced area that later became our garden. Just outside the barbed wire fence in long dresses and bare feet, I spent many hours with my flat-snouted allies.  Mud squished between my toes as I kneeled, pretending to be a piglet myself. Snort, snuff, roll, grunt. I was a blissful piggy. I didn’t know that they weren’t pets. I was in the dark until one afternoon when I was in the kitchen and Mom approached from outside. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“We are getting the pigs butchered today," she announced nonchalantly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? We can’t! I love the pigs!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“We have to, Kelly. We need the food. That is why we got them--to raise them so that we could eat them.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We did need the food. I knew that much from the number of “dumpster diving” trips that Dad was taking to Gordon Food Service, the bulk food service distributor located a few towns over. My favorite dumpster food was the variety of candy bars that he brought back. “The expiration dates are just suggestions," Mom informed us. “As long as we keep it all frozen, it never goes bad.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The freezer was filled with expired candy, milk, pizza, and vegetables. Oats, ramen noodles, eggs, and endless cereal that we normally lived on couldn’t compare to the expired gourmet meals that he brought home. And of course, anything was better than the milk that Mom made us drink straight from the local dairy farm. “It is unpasteurized and cheaper," she explained. As an adult, I wonder why she lacked concern for us potentially ingesting harmful bacteria from the raw milk. Maybe it was because, lucky for her, Mom was not a milk drinker. She never knew the disgusting taste of what she was encouraging us to consume. The off-white milk was buried by a thick yellow foam of fat and the stench was of cow's body odor--but the taste was worse. I usually resorted to eating my cereal dry.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In addition to our homegrown pork, we ate our chickens. This I wasn’t in the dark about, and it didn’t bother me much.  When Dad chopped their heads off with an axe and explained how amusing it was to watch them run around the yard headless, it was difficult for me to feel attached to them. It didn’t make sense why watching another creature die was fun, but after him chortling with bemusement at their antics, it was. Yes, I felt horrified at first, but never thought about their deaths once they were over. Well, that is until many years later when the memories flooded back in a high school classroom full of my peers and my favorite teacher. Impulsively, I joked about bloody headless chickens just like Dad had, and the eyes of terror that stared back must have been the ones that I myself gave Dad as a child. It wasn’t normal to joke about such things in the mainstream world and unfortunately, I couldn’t take my words back. I couldn’t even swallow. The embarrassment was too great. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Chickens were one thing for young me, but the grief of my piggy friends dying felt unimaginable. The idea of eating them was even worse. As I often did, I constructed a fantasy where everything turned out for the best, convincing myself that we had sold the pigs to a nice family. One that could take better care of them. “Wherever they are, they are happy," I assured myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This mindset worked well, until a rare occasion when we joined as a family to eat dinner. Gazing at the gigantic meal before us, enjoyment about eating together filled the air. It was a giant production in which we sat in order of age which meant that I dined next to my older brother Abe at the bar counter facing into the kitchen.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know we are eating our pigs, right?” he smirked, poking to elicit a reaction.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, it’s not!” My shriek was loud. “The pigs are alive! We sold them!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sure, if that is what you want to believe," his voice remained calm and steady. “Which body part do you think is on your plate?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Stop it! We aren’t eating them!” When my tears formed, his smirk turned to a satisfied laugh.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, be quiet! Why are you yelling? You’re so annoying.” Josiah was aggravated.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, Kelly, be quiet. Your voice hurts our ears," Mom chimed in. There were always so many voices echoing through the little trailer at times like this.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My body shivered with disgust. I could no longer finish my food, but knew that I was not to leave my seat until the plate was empty. My parents rarely paid attention to me, but at times like this, there was a feigned formality. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Will you at least eat my asparagus?” I pleaded with Abe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sure, if you take my corn.” Sneakily, we made the food switch when we were certain that no one was looking.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I remained at the counter long past when everyone else finished, unable to take more than a morsel of a bite at time. When no eyes were on me, I buried my food into the garbage. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look Mom, I finished my food! Can I get up now?” I held my breath, hoping she wouldn’t catch my lie.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, then you may be done with dinner now.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Satisfied, and with an empty stomach, I cleared my plate.

									<h2><i>Bullets and Bipolar Disorder</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom was pregnant with me during her and Dad’s worst domestic violence incident. She always said that his anger came from his younger years when he served as a United States Army Ranger. “Your dad has been through a lot. The army changed him. It really did.” Her face would convey pity. Thinking back, it was this explanation that she used regularly to justify his abusive behavior. Dad had a short fuse and when it lit, his eyes would darken into unrelenting rage and when he exploded, anything in his way would be damaged. Sometimes his momentary lack of sanity would result in us being whipped or the attacking of a pet, but other times, his blow-ups turned so violent it was criminal.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t remember the first time the “Dad shooting the tire out of Rebecca’s car” story was shared with me, but have heard it enough times from Mom and my siblings that it feels like my own memory. It was that horrific.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The story goes: Mom and Dad are arguing over something. I imagine it has something to do with Dad sleeping with another woman or being gone drinking too much. Maybe it has to do with Mom failing to keep the trailer clean or parent effectively. It’s most likely a mixture of many things which would spark a fuse. They are in the kitchen when Dad snaps, shoving Mom against the old faded wallpaper. He is choking her. Then fortunately, he gains enough control to release her.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;At some point during the argument, Mom had called her friend, Rebecca, to pick her up. She lives a mile up the street, across from the tavern where Dad spends his drunken nights. She has a humor that could bruise your belly, but she is not to be tested. When triggered, her army days left her with the same dark fury as Dad. Rebecca calls the police.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Well before the police arrive, she pulls up in her old sedan and Mom crams James, Jacob, Chase and Abe into the back seat. Unable to find six-year-old Josiah, she scrambles back to the trailer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She returns in tears, alone. “Kurt won’t let me have him! Just go. We have to get out of here fast!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the car backs out of the driveway, Dad storms through the trailer door with a gun, maybe a pistol or rifle--that part is still unclear since he has so many of them. When they reach the street, just past the white pines that line the yard, he fires.  Rebecca, who is also pregnant, doesn’t hesitate and blasts down the road with the flat tire. Within the month, she would give birth to Kelsey, my lifelong friend, but at this moment she is barreling down County Road 384 with my hysterical pregnant mother, four frightened children and a thumping tire.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly after reaching her house, there is a knock on the door. Everyone sighs with relief when they find the police on the other side with Josiah, not Dad.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When we were adults, Jacob revealed to me that Dad had been pulled over and arrested just down the street. They were uncertain whether he was heading for Rebecca’s, the bar, or Canada. The police informed them they would have shot Dad on the spot had a child not been with him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Jacob also recalls that two months later Mom held a house meeting to discuss the matter of Dad nearly killing his family. “I wrote the judge a letter asking that they release your dad. I do not know why he gets so angry like that, but he doesn’t mean it. It’s just because he loves us so much. Divorce is a sin, so I have to stay with him. As a woman, I am supposed to honor my husband and should not have gotten angry back. It’s really my fault. God calls us to forgive so we will forgive your dad like Jesus wants us to.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Apparently Dad hid the evidence by dumping the gun in the backyard swamp, so between the letter to the judge and the lack of evidence, he was released from jail. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The shooting incident just became another family story. The abuse cycle continued and Mom maintained her stance of God calling her to “turn the other cheek, forgive and forget.” Her children became like ducklings, following their mother into uncertain territory, trusting she would keep them safe, only to be led toward danger. 
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall Mom and Dad’s fuming arguments came daily. One night, I sat in the living room hearing their voices roar in the kitchen. Tucked between the bookshelf and wall,  I pull my knees to my chest. I need to stay out of the warpath. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re crazy. Even the doctor said it. I heard him. He said you are bi-polar. BI-POLAR!  He said it himself and you need to take your lithium because your chemicals are all out of whack and it makes you all crazy. If you want to get better, you take your lithium. Dur dur dur. You would think it would be obvious. I never know what I’m going to get with you! You’re one way one second and a crazy person the next! Your brain is all fucked up!” Dad is taunting her in his best mocking voice while pointing at the side of his head spinning his finger in circles to indicate her being “crazy”. Mom tries to speak but he barks over her. It bellows so loud that my head feels like it might explode. I can’t even hear my own thoughts. These fights happen multiple times per week, and I’m aching for them to stop. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom screams back so hard I worry her vocal cords might rip apart. “Maybe if you were here to help take care of your kids then I wouldn’t have to be crazy! I hate you! I hate you Kurt! I wish you were dead and that I had never met you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!” She becomes louder with each sentence. But no amount of words or screaming could truly express the rage she must have felt. Years later I would learn about bipolar disorder as associated with mood swings that can range between depressive lows and manic highs that can often be managed with medication and psychotherapy. But at such a young age, I feared the worst. Was something going to happen to Mom?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I close my eyes and plug my ears, but it doesn’t drown the sound. My siblings are nowhere in sight; they must be hiding further away.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Racing to my bedroom, I bury myself deep into the closet, disappearing into darkness. Feeling torn, an internal battle begins between wanting the noise gone and needing to hear what is happening.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The moment Mom says, “I am leaving and never coming back! You can raise your kids by yourself and see how well you do!” I knew that it was time to scurry to her van quickly enough to hide in the back before she realizes I’m there. Sometimes, I hide here the moment the fights start, always knowing that this is how they end. I can’t live without my mom and staying with Dad wouldn’t be safe, so I must always be thinking of a plan.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In an effort to regain control, my mind now searches for solutions. Mom thinks we kids are too much now, but if she leaves with just me I can make her happy. Once she sees and knows me, it will be impossible for her to not love me. Mom and I can take on the world together. I will follow every instruction and stay as silent as possible--so silent she won’t even know that I am there. I will make her laugh, and it will be impossible for her to not like me. Then, there will be no way that I am too much and she will have to let me stay. I always manage to convince myself that this will work. But no matter how many times I hide in her van, she always returns me to the trailer the moment she notices.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please Mom, just let me come with you! I will be good! I will be good! I really will Mom! I’ll be good! I promise! You won’t even know I’m here! Just please don’t leave me!” My words are frantic on her trips to drop me back off. Wanting to say the one right thing that will convince her to let me stay with her. But I can never find it. In my moment of desperation, even though it has never worked, I think that if I repeat this enough she just might be persuaded.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes she convinces me to leave the van on my own. These were rare occasions. “Are you ever coming back?” I ask earnestly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know Kelly. I just don’t know. I’m so unhappy,” is her usual response.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The times she rips me from the van, I chase her down the gravel driveway choking on tears as I beg her not to leave me. I have one focus: getting to Mom. It is survival, and my mind can’t see past this. I am desperate and searching for whatever means possible to get to her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes I chase her down County Road 384, all the way past the dump, until her van disappears. But usually I just return to the trailer where I proceed to call her cellphone on repeat. If she answers, I continue begging “Please Mom! Please let me come with you! I promise I will be good! I just want to be with you!” When she declines, I change my tactic: “Will you at least just stay on the phone with me? You don’t have to talk or say anything, just please stay on the phone with me. Don’t leave Mom. Just please. I need you.” This way, we can know we were both safe without having to talk. There’s no way I can overwhelm her if we aren’t even talking. I could be in her “presence” without overwhelming her. She would always say no and hang up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By this time, Dad would have grabbed his beer and disappeared into the woods or his workshop, an old mobile home located in our make yard.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Each time she hung up on me, I lost more control and got more desperate, repeatedly clicking “redial” on the cordless phone. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brothers would groan in annoyance: “Seriously Kelly, why are you still crying? Just stop, you’re being so annoying.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Similar to a wild animal in survival, I could feel my eyes glazing over when raging at them. At times I would  scream until I feared my own vocal cords would split open. “SHUT UP! Leave me alone! I hate you guys! I hate you! I hate you! I HATE YOU!” My voice would grow until my throat hurt. <i>Is this how Mom feels?</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;If they pester me, I attack: hitting, scratching, and screaming until someone strong enough yanks my hair or grabs my arm so hard I retreat. My aggressive survival mode is more wild than any animal. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Mom stops answering my repeated phone calls, her voicemail clicks on: “Hi, you have reached Penny Cole. Please leave your name, number and a detailed message and I will return your call just as soon as I can. Thanks and have a blessed day.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After I fill her voicemail, I pace the trailer and yard, unable to stop myself from crying. Sometimes I wander to the street looking as far as I can, hoping to see her van approaching from the distance. Eventually, I return to the trailer and look over the back of the couch, out the front window, and down the driveway. Not daring to move my eyes until she returns. Everything in me aches and I can’t feel safe until I see her again. If she doesn’t come, I will fall asleep from exhaustion.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I reflect on these repeated memories of abandonment, I remember being so sad, empty and scared. The only thing that felt safe in the entire world was Mom, but no matter what I did or didn’t do, she never wanted me. It’s like those bad dreams when you are running away from something trying to kill you. Except in the dream, no matter how hard you try, you can only move in slow motion, getting more scared and no closer to safety until eventually, the monster, still running full speed, catches you. Mom’s reach was so close that I could almost feel the relief of safety. It was like reaching out to touch her hand and finding out it was a shadow--because each time, she ripped it away, leaving me to be devoured by the monsters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I only remember one time in which she allowed me to stay with her. I remained completely silent in the van as she drove to the beach. Suddenly, I felt safe knowing where she went when she left us behind. She often talked about going to the beach to pray alone, but my mind never made that connection because I was usually overloaded with emotions.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sitting on the blue steps at the top of the bluff, Mom cries so hard I’m not sure if she’s breathing. It is a summer night and the lakeshore breeze wafts through the air. I remain silent, listening to the crash of the Lake Michigan waves. Mom is right, the lake does have a calming effect.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Finally, she talks. Her words and tears aren’t unusual, I hear them daily. This time feels different solely because it is on a trip when she is “leaving” Dad.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I can’t do anything right," her voice shakes and pauses for more tears. “I try so hard and nobody loves me. Your Dad hates me. You kids hate me. No matter what I do, it’s never enough. I mean, I know people say they love me. But nobody really truly loves me. You know?” I don’t know, but I nod in silence, trying to know. “I wish I was dead. I can’t do this anymore.” Her tears continue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I pause to think, wondering what the one right line is that will help her. “That’s not true Mom, lots of people love you. I love you. I do love you Mom. I really do. Isn’t that enough?” My voice is focused. If I can get her calm, she will want to live. Helping her will also prove that I am not too much. If I save her, then she will love me. Then she will see that we don’t need anyone else in the world who makes us unhappy. Just the two of us and whichever siblings promise not to cause trouble can be happy together.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I know you do. But I still can’t do it. It’s too much." She cries even harder.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>Did I say something wrong?</i> I wonder.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At nine years old, I am unaware of the skills that I’m developing for talking with someone who is mentally unstable--skills that would be honed many years later as a social worker for at-risk children and adults. But at this time, it’s survival.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I need you Mom. And you do so many things right. You take care of us kids and teach us our school. You are a lot better than Dad and I would want to be with you over him anytime.” Being better than Dad will certainly lift her spirits. I know it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Really Kelly, you mean that?” She sits taller and hope forms in her voice. My words are working.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I hate Dad. We all hate Dad. He’s mean," I continue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re right.” She pauses to think and her eyes become distant, staring off. “I don’t know why he’s like that.” Then, her head drops with sorrow. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Uncertain what to say, I snuggle her for a hug while thinking of something that might make her laugh. She fastens her arms around me while continuing to cry. I will probably find a past story where we make fun of someone so hard that we laugh until we cry. But the story doesn’t matter. Whatever it takes to remain here in her arms, safe from the world. That’s what matters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once she was cheered up, she would say, “Oh Kelly, thank you for cheering me up. You’re my special girl and I don’t know what I would do without you. You know that? You really do love me.” It’s all of the words I labor to hear. Right here, the foundation of my worth being based on what I can do for others was solidifying. 										

										<br></p>

										<p><br>

										&emsp;&emsp;One time, Mom actually took all of us kids with her when she ran away from home after a particularly bad fight with Dad. I remember it being nighttime when she gathered us into the van. As she drove us down County Road 384, I was uncertain if we would ever see the trailer again. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall riding through the ghostly town in silence, only talking to calm Mom when she began to cry again. Occasionally, one of us grunted at the other for being crammed too closely in the seats. But, eventually, we stopped at a fast food joint and Mom ordered each of us a sandwich from the “dollar menu”. She parked at a rundown motel down the street so that we could eat our roast beef sandwiches in silence. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It was late into the night and we were all exhausted, so Mom headed into the motel to get us a room. When she returned, she plopped her head on the steering wheel and sobbed. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t have enough money, and they won’t let us stay. I told them that I have kids but they wouldn’t let us." Her voice trembled with hopelessness. “I guess we are going to sleep in here for tonight.” So, eight of us snuggled in to sleep as best we could in the overcrowded van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know how the others felt at these times, but to me, it seemed as real as the impending apocalypse. It seemed that we were now embarking on a life without Dad and leaving everything we knew behind. One would think that I would see these impulsive acts as patterns of dysfunction from a mentally unstable person, but as a trusting child, I thought: this is it, we are never returning. I also lacked the knowledge of the amount of support and resources it takes for a single mom to leave an abusive relationship. I fell asleep, propped up against Sarah’s small body, with the certainty that I’d never see my home, pets or father again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When the sun lifted above the town, Mom knew Dad had left for work so she drove us home. Life would go on as normal. “God doesn’t believe in divorce. As a woman, I need to honor and respect your father. God would want me to forgive.” Whenever she said this, I was never sure if she was trying to convince us or herself.

									<h2><i>Egg Yolk and Blood</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad built our chicken coop with plywood and hex netting just beside a pond in the backyard. Because we never cleaned the coop, a thick coating of chicken droppings covered the ground inside, creating a foul stench of manure and swamp. Eventually, a build-up of excrement prevented the door from closing properly which allowed the chickens to escape with regularity. One day after I poured chicken feed into the trough, a rooster charged me and as I sprinted for the trailer, the chicken coop door snapped shut behind me--except because the door didn’t fully shut, the rooster was able to slip through and continue his charge. I swatted the food bucket aimlessly behind me and when I heard him moving in on me, I went for one last whack at him before reaching the trailer. He lurched through the air, landing on my back. When he slid off, his claws left a six-inch scratch gushing blood down my calf.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know if my dislike for chickens began following this incident, or the time when I found two of them dead with hundreds of maggots crawling from their bodies. Not only were the chickens uncompromising, but they were disgusting to me. Of all our pets, why did we have chickens? They woke us up way too early in the morning, didn’t snuggle and wanted nothing to do with us. Even so, my daily chore was caring for them.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One morning, I shivered my way across the frost-covered ground for the morning egg collection. Inside the chicken coop were four square roosting boxes filled with small mounds of hay. There were so many eggs laid that morning that when my plastic Neapolitan ice cream bucket was filled and there were still more to collect, I wondered if I had forgotten to do my chore the day prior. I paused to think of an easy solution. I could return to the house for another bucket, but that’s a long walk, so I searched the area for a similar container. Nothing. Determined to complete the task in one trip, I stack the extra ones on top.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Walking ever so carefully with the overflowing bucket of eggs, I eventually reached the kitchen refrigerator. Slowly, I moved a hand from the bucket to open the fridge. My breath caught as I watched a small white egg tumble and splatter onto the floor. From across the room, Dad witnessed the accident. My shame response was immediate: <i>I’m so stupid. I knew I needed to make two trips, but I did not do that because I’m lazy. Gosh, I’m so stupid.</i> Even at the young age of seven years old, Dad’s harsh narrative about me was engraved in my mind and had become my own internal dialogue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I stood frozen in terror as he approached with a tight jaw and eyes that could destroy. He towered over me in anger. 
													<br>
													&emsp;&emsp;“You think it’s okay to drop eggs on my kitchen floor? You’re so lazy and stupid that you couldn’t use your brain to think for just a second! Huh? What are you, a retard?” His voice is mocking, but I’m too scared to listen so it becomes distant, as if coming through a thick fog. My face burns with humiliation and my throat stretches tight. I need to cry, but I don’t dare do it. Then, I hear his voice again. “You’re going to waste eggs?! I’ll show you not to waste eggs!” He grabs an egg from the bucket I’m still holding and smashes on top of my head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He snatches the bucket from my hands, shoves me, and commands “Now go take a shower!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I rush to the shower, unable to breathe from holding too many tears in. No, maybe it’s from holding too much fear in. Or, is it anger? I suppose maybe a bit of everything.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After I close the bathroom door, I release what I can in silent sobs. My chest is heavy with bricks and it’s impossible for air to enter. Each forced breath comes with more shaky, heavy and overwhelming tears. No matter how much I rinse and wash, my hair still feels coated in goopy egg yolk. I am left to figure out another problem with nobody around to guide me. When experiencing a traumatic event, the body's nervous system will commonly respond in one of four ways: by fighting the threat, freezing,  running away or a fawn response, in which the victim attempts to please an abuser to avoid conflict. My brain and body knew the safest option with dad was to freeze, but the threat would never truly be gone until I could disappear from his presence.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, I give up on my hair and collapse onto the floor of the tub, my limbs weak from trembling in fear.  Finally, at the end of the shower I regain my mental strength and think: <i>I may be stupid, but at least now I know the secret ingredient to the world’s softest and shiniest hair.</i> Somehow, I was creating a coping mechanism of finding the positive in even the most humiliating of circumstances.

										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;Not all of my experiences with Dad were painful. Mom always said that he did well with babies and younger kids. Once we got older, she explained, he didn’t know how to get along with us. Around the age of six, Dad and I had a connection. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Most mornings, upon waking, I heard the 1970s mellow song “I Feel the Earth Move” by Carole King coming from his record player. It was my favorite. Still dark outside, everyone would have still been sleeping but they wouldn’t have been asleep for long, as most days my siblings were up until the late hours of the night and did not wake until well into the afternoon.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I typically avoided the kitchen. It was where the mice scampered across the stove, through the pantry, and under the fridge. Sometimes they were found dead in the dirty dishes, unable to escape from the sink. Or, on one occasion, the inside of a pop can. But mornings with Dad made me untouchable to the mice. Being on his good side in those moments meant that his rage would be directed toward anything in the world but me. His aggression would be used to protect, not harm me. <i>Is that how mom felt?</i>
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;He had a tenderness about him--a softness that I only ever saw him have toward his own mother. Sometimes he discussed his music or army days but mostly, we enjoyed each other's presence in silence. Each morning he boiled a pot of water and added two cheap packages of chicken ramen noodles. As the noodles softened, he threw in slices from a brick of Velveeta cheese. I watched him intently, soaking up the enjoyment of him cooking me breakfast. At the table, he poured milk, which stained his light brown mustaches white as he sipped between bites. He flashed occasional smiles in my direction, not needing words to show he enjoyed my presence.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;After breakfast, he sat at the table lacing his steel-toe Timberland boots, wrapping the string around the boots multiple times.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Alright Kelly-girl, let’s get you back to bed.” It was still 5:30am and Mom would be asleep for a few more hours. When left awake, I inevitably got bored and woke my siblings. He knew that the best option for getting me back to sleep was with a quick goodbye kiss and leaving me to snuggle with Mom. Everything felt safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On the weekends, Dad let me spend more time with him. Saturday mornings we headed to the town dump just a quarter mile down County Road 384. We unloaded trash cans from the back of his truck into big metal containers. On days when the bins were full, big trucks came to empty them out. Life was chaotic, but the engines roaring and clanking noises from the dump on Saturday mornings were consistent.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But the dump wasn’t only for dropping off trash, it was also for finding treasures. James 's wife, Monica, tells a traumatizing story of when Mom made her dinner at the trailer. Cramped at the kitchen table, she was in the middle of her meal when Mom exclaimed “Isn’t this turkey great! I found it down the street at the dump and just couldn’t believe that someone was throwing a whole turkey away!” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Monica finishes the story by asserting an uncomfortable “Uh, okay… not eating her food again.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I usually respond to such stories with an embarrassed eye roll and something like: “Ya, Gross. She’s crazy.” Thinking back, this makes me wonder how many of our meals came from the town dump. I laugh as these thoughts come, picturing Mom’s voice saying, “It's ok, It will just build your immune system.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Aside from dumping trash, Dad did other “manly” duties like yard work, hunting, or fixing machines. I enjoyed the rare occasion that he let me tag along when working on his truck at a friend's garage. It was quiet and he brought good food, like Subway sandwiches, for lunch. He enjoyed the calm and quiet with nothing more than the light sound of his radio streaming late 90s country music from the far end of the garage. Occasionally, he asked for a tool or told me about what he was doing.  But mostly, he became irritable when I talked so I watched in silence, learning to enjoy the stillness. I developed this skill so well that for many years, I became mute at the mere sign of male presence. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My favorite experiences with Dad were trips into our woods to cut firewood. He mostly did this in the fall so we wore orange hats and jackets, just in case any deer hunters had snuck onto our property. The roar of his chainsaw was loud, but I didn’t mind because the sweet smell of the freshly cut trees made up for it. I stared in astonishment as powdered tree shavings piled onto the ground, wondering how a machine so small could have enough power to cut an entire tree. Dad gave me instructions on where to stand and sit, which was usually in the back of the truck. He wanted to be sure that I was safe from any trees falling my way. I loved that Dad noticed such things and was diligent about keeping me safe. I followed every instruction, showing him how good I could be. Longing for him to be proud. Hoping to be perfect enough to never again trigger his anger.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes the trees needed a push to go in the right direction. “Tiiimmmbbbbeeeerrr!!!” Dad would shout through a laugh, then smile at me to share the enjoyment.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was in awe of him. He was smart and took the time to teach me things. One day, he went on a tangent about army days and how “you survive on what you can”.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, look here! Take some of these!” I looked at him curiously as he placed little red berries into my hand. Their colors were vibrant and they had a perfectly smooth roundness. I am certain he said the name of them, but the memory has slipped away from me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look, try one!” he popped a handful into his mouth. “If you are ever stuck in the wilderness you need to know what is safe to eat, it’s these here, you can tell by the leaf!” He continued on his explanation, excited that I was interested.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I ate them, I realized they didn’t have much flavor. It kind of reminded me of dull cardboard. And the texture was strange, they crumbled more than smooshed in my mouth. Regardless, I spent years playing imagination games where I was surviving off of little red berries in the wilderness.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Dad was done with the chainsaw, he placed big logs onto the tree stump and cut them smaller with an axe. From there, I was finally able to make myself useful by carrying pieces, one log at a time, to the truck. Being sure to stack them in the very specific rows that he had taught me. It was my special time with him and I felt extra proud when he trusted me to help. For those moments, I truly was daddy’s little girl. But moments were all they were. We would return to the trailer, his irritability would return and anyone might fall victim to his horrendous abuse. Even me.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Touching the Carpet” was my favorite childhood game. The object was to get from one destination to another without touching the carpet, which was lava. One day, when I was around the age of seven, Abe, Sarah, and I made the goal of getting from the boys' bedroom at one end of the trailer, to the kitchen located just after the hall and living room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I set to making my game plan. The hall would be the most difficult challenge, so I search the area, then collect toys and shoes that I can drop and step on as I go. Once I reach the living room, I will be out of supplies. “That’s okay, I’ll use the furniture!” I continue planning.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Except the living room furniture is more difficult to navigate than anticipated. I pause to think, knowing that I need a new plan. Ah, I’ll just follow Abe! I won’t come in first, but I won’t be last either!
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my right, Sarah moves along the couch, not noticing that there will be nothing to climb onto once she reaches the end. Abe heads for the chest of drawers, our peculiar television stand. After that obstacle, it will be a straight shot to the kitchen.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Climbing the chest of drawers is harder than I thought so I use Abe’s tactic of pulling the drawers open and hoisting myself up. My toes balance on top of the dresser and heels hang off the edge. I would have taken a different route had I known how little space was up here. As my feet slide toward the other end, my balance slips. When my left hand struggles to grasp the tv, the right goes for a metal object beside it--a TV aerial mounted onto the wall. Dad usually keeps it outside on the roof but for whatever reason, it is inside at this time. It doesn’t hold my weight, but it does provide what I need to regain balance. Abe has already made it back down and as I steady myself, the aerial falls, piercing the top of his head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The game is over. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I climb down the drawers and to his side. Blood is gushing from his puncture wound, his dark blonde hair is soaked with it. Mom suddenly appears from her bedroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh no! What happened!” she exclaims.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It was an accident. We were playing no touching carpet and the antenna fell. It was just an accident.” My voice is rushed, trying to emphasize that I did not hurt him intentionally.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kurt! I need you! Come help, quick!” Mom screams and runs to Abe’s side.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I stumble backwards, afraid of what Dad’s reaction will be.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He rushes from his bedroom, bringing the stench of beer with him. Rather than tending to the gaping wound, he turns his attention to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Dammit Kelly! Why would you drop the antenna on his head like that for?!” His hands grasp my arm and shove me down face first onto the couch. I’m held frozen while he unlatches his leather belt. My limbs flail in efforts to escape as they anticipate the sting of the blow. The first one lands and my teeth clench. I yelp with the next one. And comes another. And another. The snap of the leather striking my bottom is excruciating. The sting worsens when he misses and thrashes my thighs or calves. Or worse, my back. Fear and pain overtake me, and I can no longer breathe through my clenched chest. I lose track of how many times he whips me, hoping each one will be the last. Everything hurts. I want him to understand that it was an accident. That I would never hurt Abe on purpose. I want him to know that I try hard to be a good kid. Instead, I’m left with the  hopelessness of  knowing that I can’t escape being in trouble. I can’t escape the pain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Now get to your room and don’t come out until I say you can!” he shouts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Muscle memory guides me to the back bedroom. I can’t see through the tears. It’s the bedroom that would later become the boys’ room, but for now, it sleeps me, Abe, Chase, Sarah, Josiah, and Daniel. My bed is one of the small triple bunks that Dad had built onto the wall, but because I usually sleep on the couch or with Mom, it is filled with boxes of toys, clothes, and old blankets. Between not having a bed, and still not having permission to leave the room, I head for an open bunk bed at the other end of the room to fulfill my punishment. Who knows how long I will be in here. Sometimes Mom and Dad forget. When that happens, I call a sibling to the room, begging them to ask that I be let out. Other times, I wait for Dad to leave, then come out. But today, I imagine I will remain in this room until the next morning. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My legs and bottom are swollen, but numb. A child who knows abuse, knows that there is a point beyond the pain where there is no feeling. Instead, I work to regain my breath because air won’t fit through my chest. And my limbs shake with terror.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Still crying uncontrollably, I peek out the door, hoping that Mom will see and comfort me. Instead, I see Dad with his green metal army box that he keeps medical supplies in. Abe sits at the table crying while Dad works on his head. He is grunting about having to give him “stitches.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I close the door and return to the top bunk. My legs throb now. My bottom begins to sting. The ache in my head, throat, and chest make it impossible to stop crying. My mind conjures up images of  Mom hugging me until I can get calm again. She would tell me that it wasn’t my fault and that she knew it was an accident. It would be followed by her apologizing for Dad being mean to me. But Dad would never know. That’s what she usually did. But on this night, when I need it most, no one comes. I curl into a ball until the tears rock me to sleep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;That night would create a family story that always began with “remember that time when Kelly cracked Abe’s head open?” Everyone would laugh and breathe sighs of relief that he was okay while he touched his scar in remembrance. No one acknowledged that it wasn’t intentional. No one recalled the beating I received from playing a silly game. Such whippings were never mentioned because all of us children suffered so many--and for reasons far more unjust.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was like the dogs when they did something triggering such immense anger in Dad that he attacked them. When he finished, they whimpered, limped, made themselves small, and hid. None of us were brave enough to acknowledge the injustice and comfort them. The moment it was over, we coped by pretending it never existed at all.

										Animals III - German Shepherds
									</h3>
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;We always owned at least one purebred German Shepherd. “These are guard dogs. They will protect you and take down any bad guy who tries to hurt you," Dad assured us regularly.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;He launched into a story to prove his point. One of  Dad’s friends commented on the nice temperament of our dog, Buck. “I told him that Buck was a guard dog and would protect anyone who lives here if someone tried to hurt us but he didn’t believe me. So I said, ‘you pretend to attack me and I guarantee he will protect me,’” Dad’s voice was loud and harsh with a mocking tone. It was the tone that he used to show that someone was, as he would say, a “retard”.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;“Sure enough, he put his arms up like he was going to hurt me and Buck put a hole right into his stomach.” By this part of the story, his hoarse smoker's voice was laughing with satisfaction. He had proven his point.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Given how much Dad beat the dogs, I didn’t understand why they protected him. He raged on the gentle creatures for simple things like getting in his way, eating out of the trash, or having a rare potty accident in the house. His method of training was to attack and show them who was in control. “That is how you earn their respect," Dad explained to us. But what I saw was a lack of control all around. Something would snap in Dad. His eyes became dark and before anyone could blink, the dogs would be pinned down, choked, and beaten. Their pitiful whimpers didn’t stop him. He only released when the rage passed. The moment he did, they cowered, wet themselves, and hid, just like us kids. Dad would then move on as if nothing had happened, often looking confused as to why people and animals feared him.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;The dog's loyalty compared to Mom’s never-ending forgiveness of Dad. Whether they protected him in hopes of earning his respect or out of fear--or because they genuinely loved him--was uncertain. Maybe it was a mixture of all. My guess is that it was survival. Follow the instruction to avoid the abuse.

											&emsp;&emsp;Our dogs died for numerous reasons. The first one, Sasha, had been one of my favorites. Dad had been struggling to get along with our neighbors which was not uncommon, as his temper impacted many of his relationships. One night he burst through the back door. He was furious. Attempting to control his emotions, he rubbed his hand through his brown curly hair while pacing the living room. 
												<br>
												&emsp;&emsp;“The dog’s dead. That retard neighbor poisoned her. I found her lying dead on that side of the house.” He pointed toward the direction of his and Mom’s bedroom.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;My body shook as I attempted to wrap my mind around how the dog was dead and worse, that she had been poisoned! I did not know if I was more afraid of the dog's death, Dad’s anger, or the neighbor who he was convinced had killed her. Whatever the cause, it was to my dismay that Sasha had indeed been found dead outside.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;She was replaced with another German Shepherd dog, Lady, who later birthed purebred puppies. Being the runt of the litter, our new family favorite pup, Max, appeared much smaller than any German Shepherd I had ever seen. Intelligence made up for his small stature, making him a wonderfully calm and well-trained pet. Most of my family avoided the animals, as they all had serious infestations of fleas. I figured that the house was infested anyway, so I didn’t see the difference. Snuggling with him on the floor became my favorite pastime. Besides, the flea bites left only small red marks on my body, unlike Mom, who they seemed to torture relentlessly.
												<br>
												&emsp;&emsp;One day, Max was hit by a car, leaving his back leg broken. Searching for a solution, Dad headed to Menard’s, the local hardware store, to buy materials for making a cast. Max appeared miserable attempting to walk with a bulky homemade cast on his leg.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Efforts to heal it with a cast failed, as Max inevitably found ways to chew it off. “That’s it, he can’t continue living in pain like this.” Irritated, Dad went to his safe and retrieved a gun.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Sarah and I concocted a solution. Vet expenses were too high, but what about a cone to stop him from chewing the cast? Neither of us mustered the bravery to share our ideas with Dad.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;“Stay inside, I have to go take care of Max.” Dad hurried through the living room with his pistol.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t dare move.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Staring at the door from the living room, time froze when the gunshot rang through the air.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;By the time I gathered the nerve to go outside, Dad was moving Max, who was wearing a plastic grocery bag over his head. “If you get them right in the temple it is a quick death. They die before they even know what has happened," Dad attempted to reassure us. Puddles of blood bubbled in the dirt. 
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;In some ways, knowing his death was quick did provide reassurance. In other ways, I grappled with another meaningless death due to my parents’ failure to take care of their pets’ basic needs. Some creatures, it seems, aren’t worthy of protecting--no matter how loved or loyal they are. I would soon learn to never take a moment with loved ones for granted, while the fear of what might happen without their presence settled in my soul’s core.

									<h2><i>Grandma Reed</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Holidays were another reminder of how different our family was from the rest of the world. Halloween was satanic, so evil that I genuinely feared it. Not celebrating a holiday with pagan roots made sense in some of our church circles. But not celebrating Christian holidays like Easter and Christmas solicited strange looks--even from our conservative community. Mom thought that Easter idolized the bunny too much, rather than focusing on the Resurrection. She explained that we didn’t celebrate Christmas because of its pagan roots. “Besides,” she would say, “we don’t truly even know when Jesus was born anyway.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know if I felt more embarrassed or confused about not partaking in the typical children’s activities such as shopping for gifts, dying Easter Eggs, or getting pictures with Santa. We didn’t even attend Sunday services on days when Easter or Christmas sermons were planned. On rare occasions, I talked Mom into letting me attend a local Church’s Wednesday night youth group. But she only agreed because I promised that I wouldn’t partake in anything related to the Easter Bunny or Christmas.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Keeping my promise while participating with my friends required creativity. When we decorated Christmas cookies, I chose the snowman one. “It resembles winter, not Christmas," I assured Mom. If we did an art activity, I made mine about snowflakes. Easter was more difficult and I found myself sitting out of many Easter egg hunts. Fortunately, my friends were patient with me, sharing candy of their own.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So, why don’t you celebrate Jesus’ birth or resurrection?” They were genuinely as confused as I was.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know, my Mom just thinks they are satanic or something like that. I don’t know, she’s weird like that.” Each time someone asked, my jaw tightened and blood flooded my cheeks. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad disagreed with Mom on Christmas. And although her views were strong, she was more afraid of Dad. So when he took us to Grandma Reeds’ home each Christmas, she stayed silent.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he could afford it, he even bought us gifts of his own. Before going to Grandma Reed’ we enthusiastically unwrapped new sleds, board games, and clothing. “Remember, we don’t celebrate Christmas. This is just something nice that your dad wanted to do for you," Mom reminded us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But the gifts were often followed by Dad’s “Merry Christmas, you guys!” His smile was genuine on days when visiting Grandma was in our schedule. He adored her like no one else.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But, Mom didn’t like Grandma Reed. “She acts like she is better than everyone else,” she’d complain. “And we always have to go visit her. She can never drive thirty minutes to see her own grandkids. If she cares about you guys, she will have to come here to visit.” Because of this, we saw her twice a year: at my Uncle Chad’s on Thanksgiving and a month later at her house on Christmas Day. Mom rarely came to her Christmas celebrations. Instead, she passed up yet another opportunity of spending time with her kids to be alone in prayer. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t understand Mom’s dislike for Grandma Reed because I loved her just as dearly as Dad did. Each year when we arrived, she greeted us with big smiles, hugs and kisses. When she made it to me she would squeeze my cheeks and exclaim “you still have those beautiful dimples!” The pinching hurt, but it didn’t matter because it was Grandma.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My father’s father, Grandpa Cole, died many years before I was born. What little I know about him was from Mom. “He was not a nice man. I really think he was pretty physically abusive to your dad and his brothers," she would explain with pity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometime after he died, Grandma married Grandpa Reed. Mom didn’t like him either. “He doesn’t like kids and is just rude," she would mutter every time we went over there. I felt confused by this because as a young girl, I felt perfectly comfortable around him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In my younger years, Grandma took us straight to the basement where we rode scooters on the concrete floor and played “Pin the Tail on the Donkey”. I was so young when Grandpa Reed died that I barely remember him, but I clearly remember Mom informing us of his death because it became a joke around our trailer. “Kids, your Grandpa Reed died. It actually sounds like he had a heart attack while he was on the toilet.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One of my brothers laughed, “Wait, he died on the toilet?!” His amusement was so contagious that the rest of us joined in the laughter.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I guess he did technically die on the toilet!” Mom burst into giggles along with us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After his death, we were never allowed into Grandma’s basement again but I was never sure why. I always wondered if that was where she kept his special belongings. Instead, we spent the holiday in her living room. Her house was outdated. The furniture and appliances looked like they hadn’t been changed out since the 1960s or 1970s. Yet somehow, they were so well maintained that they still looked new. The warm home smelled of green bean casserole, bread rolls, and my favorite, baked beans. Knowing how many I would eat, Grandma always made extra. I would eat firsts, seconds, thirds, and even fourths on baked beans. Even with my stuffed tummy, she would continue piling more servings on my plate. “You’re not full already, are you?! I made extra knowing how much you love them! Here, eat up!” She knew I couldn’t resist. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In the living room was a yellow velvet couch that she had covered in clear plastic for protection. Next to it was a small novelty Christmas tree that opened its eyes and sang holiday tunes when it sensed movement. Someone different played “Santa” every year and handed out our gifts. I remember nearly every gift she got me over the years. A pink sparkling jewelry box, a talking teddy bear, sticker earrings, and beautiful silver and gold jewelry.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One Christmas, I unwrapped a silver charm bracelet and my tummy fluttered. It was the exact type that many of my friends were wearing. My excitement was followed by a deep pit in my stomach when I remembered that the reason I didn’t already have one was because Mom didn’t believe in charm bracelets. Her words came to me, “Charms are magic and magic is the devil’s form of prayer. I don’t think I want you to have one because it’s satanic.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Maybe since it is a special gift from Grandma she will let me keep it, I tried to convince myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After gifts, we would watch a movie while playing with our new games and toys. Although there were many to choose from, we always landed on one of three films: the 1978 version of <i>Pinocchio</i>, the 1937 <i>Snow White</i> movie, or, Dad’s favorite, <i>The Sound of Music</i>. Watching <i>Snow White</i> on Christmas was my favorite because since Disney films have magic themes, Mom forbade us from watching it. While my friends watched Disney princesses, I regularly enjoyed Anne of <i>Green Gables</i>, <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>, war movies, and doomsday movies.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Here, come sit with me!” Grandma would pat the couch, excited to catch up. Snuggling into her side, she asked me questions about my life while her long nails gently scratched my back and arms, making it difficult to stay awake. Christmas Day at Grandma’s felt like the most normal thing in my life. A day when I got to belong to the world.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sadness filled me when it came time to leave. Grandma always stood in her driveway, waving until we were out of sight. Pressing myself as close to the window as I could, I returned the wave, keeping my eyes on her for as long as possible. I ached to remain in her presence.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It was usually dark by the time we got back home. On the day I received my charm bracelet, I greeted Mom with a hug in the kitchen. Dad brought the big black trash bag in that carried our gifts and my siblings dug theirs out, excited to show Mom. I was cautious, but remained hopeful. Besides, maybe Mom wouldn’t even know that it was a charm bracelet, I continued trying to convince myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, look at this beautiful bracelet that Grandma got me.” The silver hung from my wrist. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“That is nice!” She smiled with her own dimples. “Wait, isn’t that one of those charm bracelets?” Her brows furrowed. “I don’t know Kelly, those are more about magic than anything.” She was hesitant.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“But Mom, can I please keep it? I love it so much! Please don’t make me throw it away. All of my friends have them!” Tears were forming in my eyes.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, you can keep it. But you aren’t allowed to add any charms to it. Just the chain. Because the charms are the part that’s actually magic.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was disappointed because picking out charms was the most fun part. Nonetheless, I hugged her tightly in gratitude. At least she didn’t make me throw it away. That felt like a win in my book. The chain hung on my arm, carrying the memories of Grandma Reed. Mom may have sucked holiday joy away by refusing to decorate, but I clung to my bare bracelet tightly, holding onto what remained of the connection to others that I desperately desired.

									<h3>
										Animals IV - Opossum
									</h3>
									
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;Josiah and his friend, Aiden, once brought home a baby opossum. They found it on the side of the road, just after discovering its mother's carcass. We took it in, fed it, and nursed it back to health. I quickly became attached to the little grey fur ball with a funny pink nose. I observed how its tiny body fit into the palm of my hand and loved how its favorite position was twirling its tail around my finger and hanging from it. Opossums were supposed to be vicious, but I was sure that it would be my gentle forever friend. 
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;As it grew, it became more active and one night slipped through the bars of its cage. We found its lifeless body under the couch cushion where Abe slept. My heart was crushed to lose my new little friend. I never learned how it died, and I would never learn if I could tame a wild opossum. I did discover that some animals who escape from their cages don’t escape suffering.

									<h2><i>Kelly’s Hero</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;One night, shortly after losing my first tooth, Mom and Dad decided on a last minute camping trip “up north”. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, go grab nightgowns and extra underwear.” Mom’s voice is hurried as she sits on the living room floor shoving clothes into a big black trash bag. I scan the space in confusion, leaving for a camping trip at night time feels abnormal--even to a small child.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Right now?” My voice is heavy, tired.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, quickly! We have to go fast if we do not want to get there too late.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We squeeze into the van and hit the road.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Hours later I wake in a van weaving down a dirt road lined with trees. Darkness makes it difficult to see anything beyond the front headlights. Finally, we arrive at the campsite. There is nothing but shadows and trees in sight; we are alone in the forest. Dad’s camping lanterns light the air while he configures our enormous tent. My tired body is pacing the earth. I’m impatient, desperate for rest.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When morning breaks, I wake in our three-roomed canvas tent. In the room on my right Mom, Dad, and baby Avalon sleep on a luxurious air mattress while the rest of us are cushioned by sleeping bags. Sarah, Daniel and I share the middle room, leaving Josiah, Chase, and Abe crammed into the left.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I lie stiff as a board, needing to use the toilet, but debating whether it is worth the wrath of waking everyone. It’s always me needing to pee before everyone else. I try waiting for someone else to wake up, that way I won’t be the first to stir the crowd. But inevitably, it takes too long.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom,” I whisper, finally gaining the courage. “I have to go to the bathroom.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Loud groans from my siblings erupt as my voice wakes them. Some form of “Be quiet! We are trying to sleep!” shoots from every direction.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Does anyone else have to go? If so, you should go now so that we don’t have to make two trips.” Mom doesn’t whisper.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Some join us and others complain as we maneuver our way from the tent. We are indeed surrounded by trees, but it is not the campsite that I remember from the night before. Instead, across a dirt path, there is a sandy beach and lake right in front of us. A couple hundred feet down the path, are other campers. Mom grabs the toilet seat that we bring for camping trips, and directs us deep into the woods behind our tent. After digging a hole, she places the seat on top and hands me a roll of toilet paper. “Alright, now you go and I’ll turn around to keep watch. Then we will switch and you can keep watch for me.” She explains as I use our makeshift porta-a-potty.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When afternoon rolls in, Mom instructs us to put on our swimsuits. My tummy flutters with excitement as I slip into my hot pink one piece swimsuit with a cover up. The sunny air is warm, making it the perfect swim weather. Sitting on the tiny beach I scoop sun-soaked sand into my hands and let it fall onto my legs, relaxing in its warmth. Eventually, sweat makes me sticky and uncomfortable enough to join my siblings in the water.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, come swim with us!” my brothers shout. We love the rare occasion that Mom spends time with us. A united cheer breaks out when, at last, their persistence pays off. She enters the water, swimsuit cover-up still on to ensure modesty and her long black hair pulled back into a tight braid.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Will you go out into the deep water with me?” Josiah begs. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Mom, stay and play with me!” I plead, suddenly feeling in competition over her attention.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom responds, “I am going out with Josiah, but you can walk with us until the water gets up to your chest. Okay?” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Satisfied, my little legs prance underwater in efforts to keep up with them.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay Kelly, this is far enough. I am going to go out with Josiah. You stay and wait here. Do not go any farther.” Still too young to swim, she knows that deep waters aren’t safe for me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“But can’t you carry me? Please Mom! I want to come with you!” I whine, not wanting her to leave my side.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Kelly, I will be back in just a few minutes. Wait here, okay?” She pauses, then continues, “There is a drop-off in the sand just up here so you need to stay where you are.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I watch in disappointment as their figures become smaller with each step. Desperate to keep as close as I can, I inch forward, curious how far I can go into the water while still touching.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Suddenly, the tips of my toes abruptly skid downward and I’ve lost ground. It’s the drop-off Mom had warned me about. My feet kick, wildly searching for the lost bottom. I’m panicking. I fight to remain above water, but my head sinks. Then, I reach the surface, flailing relentlessly only to sink again. One more peak above water and the words screech violently, “Mom, HELP!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her eyes widen with shock as she turns around. “Josiah, go get her! Quickly! Go, go, go! Go get her!” she shoves his arm and dives into a swim. I see their small bodies, so far away. Then, I’m down again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My body is losing the fight, so desperate for breath that it inhales the water. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Finally, firm hands settled underneath my back and I’m carried to air. It’s Josiah. I want to breathe, but I can’t. Finally, my chest lets out loud uncontrollable coughs. My shaking arms grasp his neck tightly, not daring to let go.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you okay?” he asks, setting me down in shallow water.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Tears fall from my face. I want comfort but fear and lack of breath are so big that words cannot form.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Just then, Mom approaches, making sure I am awake and breathing. “You almost drowned! I told you not to go any farther and that there was a drop off! What happened?!” She is concerned and hugs me. When she lets go, I hold on tighter. “I am so glad I saw you! Josiah saved your life. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Just stay here and don’t go out deep again or you’ll drown.” Josiah's voice is serious, yet caring.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom pries my hands from her, and I head for the shore, needing to be free from the lake that nearly swallowed me whole. My windpipe burns and I continue coughing water droplets. I want to cry until Mom comforts me, but my brothers will find that annoying. So, sitting back down in the sand, I hug my legs tightly to my chest. My heart is pounding, but I didn’t drown.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For years to come, Mom spoke of the day in which Josiah saved me from drowning. “Josiah saved you!” Then, she would look at my siblings, “Do you guys remember that?! Kelly’s hero. You might not be alive and here with us if it wasn’t for him. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah. The reason I lived. 
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Glen was a middle aged man who lived a mile up the street, the opposite direction from the Maple Grove Tavern. He could usually be found wearing a filthy flannel shirt and ripped blue jeans. I knew from the smell of alcohol, cigarettes and musty sweat, that he hadn’t showered in days--or even weeks.  His body appeared worn-down and aged-old, maybe from his negligent lifestyle or addiction to substances. The setup of his trailer was similar to ours, except more stinky. The scent of stale smoke loomed in the air. It wasn’t cluttered like ours, but had extra grime.  Eventually, he would move into an old camper on his Mom’s property across the street. But during most of my memories of him, he dwelled in the trailer. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Glen grossed me out. His appearance was rough, but he also gave a “vibe” that made me nauseated. Maybe my stomach was reacting to the stench, but his character was suspicious. Even though I was a small child, he seemed too interested in our family and wandered onto our property multiple times per day. Sometimes he walked from the street, other times he stumbled out of our backwoods. Mostly, he drove his little rusty red car that reeked of cigarette smoke and always swayed to our front door while gripping a brown paper bag with liquor tucked inside. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	At the trailer, he talked to my mom and brothers separately for hours. No one was interested in socializing with him, but he lingered anyway. Mom was the most sympathetic toward him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	One day, when I was around the age of seven, he and Mom were talking outside of the trailer. He had brought his daughter, Jenny, and son, Charlie, who were off playing with my brothers in the yard. “You should send’em boys over for pizza night. For my famous pizzas they like.” His words slurred.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Really? Ya. Ya. I bet they would like that.” Mom nodded in agreement.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“They can even stay the night so you don’t have to worry about it getting late," he continues.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“That’s so nice of you to do that. Really, it is. I bet they will love that and have so much fun.” As a mother of nine it could be difficult for mom to find a break for herself, so she jumped at the offers of someone wanting to help with the kids. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	When Mom closed the door, I begged. “Mom, can I go, too? Please!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah, Chase, and Abe went to Glen's for his famous pizza nights regularly throughout the years. My brothers often talked of the fun they had over there learning to make homemade pizza and adventuring in the woods. I felt left out of this fun event and wished to be included.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“No, you have to stay here," Mom instructed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	But I persisted. “Why Mom? I really want to go? Please can I go!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Because you weren’t invited. It’s a bunch of boys anyway. It is not good to have girls stay over with boys like that. They are having a boys night," she insisted. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom rarely let me stay at friends’ houses if they had boys. She was worried we might get crushes on each other and wanted to protect me from that. She was also fearful of  boys coming onto me and touching me in ways that they shouldn’t. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You have a beautiful body Kelly. The boys are going to love it. That is why you have to stay modest and never be alone with a boy. Otherwise they will take advantage of you.” I imagine that she never considered the possibility of  someone taking advantage of her boys. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“But Janette is a girl! I can just play with her!” I begged.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Nope. I said no, and that’s final. And if you keep asking then you are going to get a spanking.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the time I wondered if she actually worried about what might happen to me over there, or if she just didn’t think my brothers would want their little sister tagging along. Regardless, I am now  thankful she shielded me from the experience.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brothers, mainly Abe and Josiah, picked up on my begging to go to Glen's and saw it as an opportunity. One day, on a drive to Friday school, where homeschool gatherings were held, they pestered me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“She just wants to go to Glen's because she has a crush on Charlie," Josiah starts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I do not!” I scream. I don’t even know what a crush is. I just know that when people have one they want to kiss and hold hands. I do not want that. Charlie is funny, but grosses me out because he smells nearly as bad as his dad. Even if he didn’t smell, kissing is gross.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Abe teases, “See how you’re overreacting? That proves that you have a crush on him.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I don’t!” My face burns with rage and humiliation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, you do, we saw the way that you were looking at him today," Abe continues, amused.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Looking at him how? I was just normal!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, you weren’t, you had the eyes. The ones that say you have a crush on him.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When this happened, the teasing would continue until I would scream loud enough for Mom to step in. If she intervened, she took whatever side she was in the mood for that day. When she wasn’t around, I screamed and ran away where I then withdrew into myself. Them treating me like this made me question my own reality. <i>Did I have a crush that I wasn’t aware of? What actually was a crush? What had I been doing with my eyes?</i> I felt vulnerable, like I had sinned without knowing it. But my brothers saw. If I didn’t understand what I did wrong, I didn’t know how to fix it. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A couple of years later, Mom and Dad got into a monstrous argument over Glen. It was the middle of the night and the trailer was dark. They never cared who heard their screaming matches, but they were so upset this time that they didn’t notice me sitting on the raggedy brown carpet next to the couch watching the heated row. Something bad had happened, but I didn’t understand what.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“I told you he is a pedophile! That man is no good and deserves to burn in hell!” Dad is so close to Mom that spit shoots like venom at her face.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“I don’t know what you want me to do Kurt! I felt bad for him! He has no one and I was just trying to love him like God would want! And God would want us to forgive him! He has had such a rough life. We just need to pray for him that God will change his heart.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“He is into touching little boys! He is sick and disgusting. How dare you let our kids go over there!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom begins to cry. “Well, they’re your kids too so how about you parent them for a change! I never do anything right. I’ll never be good enough. I might as well be better off dead.” She’s regressing back into the victim role again rather than taking accountability for her lapse in judgment. Or is it hopelessness that she’s feeling? Hopelessness for failing to keep her children safe and experiencing a lack of support from her husband. I would see these responses from her many times in my life. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t remember anything else from that night, but I think Glen came over less after that. When he did, it was only when Dad was gone. I hope that the extravagant pizza nights stopped at that time, but the memories are lost on me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my knowledge, Glen's abuse toward my brothers was never discussed again. It was swept under the rug, as if it never happened. But, I can scarcely imagine the pain it caused my brothers to not only have their abuse not acknowledged, but to have the person who sexually violated them discussed as a person needing love and forgiveness--all to model God’s love.

									<h3>
										Animals V - Bunnies
									</h3>
									
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes animals wandered into our lives as strays but most of the time, we purchased them. Such was the case with our bunnies. Each summer our family went to a place called “Deer Forest” where we interacted with different farm animals. We fed deer, went on camel rides, played miniature golf, rode a Ferris wheel and traveled on a small train. A Deer Forest favorite was picking out our favorite bunnies when they sold them at the end of the summer.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;	“Please Mom, can we pick out bunnies to take home!” we pleaded. At first, Mom gave a strict “no”, but we always managed to change her mind with enough nagging.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;	“Okay guys, but it’s going to be your responsibility to feed and take care of them. Okay? Do we have a deal?” she bargained. This was a common trick for her. Once the responsibility was put on us, there was no further instruction or accountability from her. On the rare occasion she remembered, we received prompts to feed them, but beyond that, we were held liable should anything go wrong. Thinking back, I realized that Mom often agreed to things in the moment to avoid negative emotions without thinking of future consequences.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;My favorite bunny was pure white, so naturally, I named her Snowball. That winter Abe’s chore was to feed and water the rabbits.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;One morning, Abe rushed through the trailer door. “Come here! Fast! I have to show you something!” His voice was rushed. When we arrived at the shed that the bunnies cages were in, he pointed to Snowball. A bowl of solid ice sat in her cage. Next to it, she was lying stiff frozen. Abe at first appeared concerned, but quickly pushed his feelings aside and instead, took on an air of indifference.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Anger toward Abe shot through my veins. I wanted to scream at him, but knew that her death was most likely from the cold rather than lack of food. Or, what I would later realize, lack of appropriate shelter to keep the domesticated bunnies warm. It was an instance in which Mom hadn’t reasoned through what else they might need to survive beyond trusting children to feed and water them. I imagine Mom falling into this same trap when deciding to have nine children. She made a decision based on what she wanted at the moment, without properly thinking about how to afford or care for so many people on such a low household income. In addition, she didn’t recognize that so many people wouldn’t fit into a small trailer. This failure to plan meant there was no means or support to create the structured and healthy environment that children need. We were no better off than the bunnies.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;But as a young girl, I felt an overwhelming guilt for not making it a priority to check on Snowball more often. Mom would provide hugs for comfort but ultimately remind me that the responsibility had been on us kids to take proper care of the animals. Not only did she put too much responsibility on us, she failed to provide effective resources and education for keeping the animals healthy. We were set up to fail. But if anyone dare speak of the injustices, she reverted to her victim state, reminding us that we “made” her buy the animals and that actually, we “owed” her for doing a kind deed. What seemed to be acts of kindness were actually strings being tied tightly around us as means of control and for the animals it always seemed to end in suffering or death. 
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;The next year, we were sure to not make the same mistake with the bunnies. Amazingly, our beautiful all black bunny, Midnight, lived longer than any of our other animals. Shortly after getting her, she had babies of her own that also became our pets. Together, they made their home burrowed under our shed. We soon learned that this provided them with warmth during harsh winters, and safety from getting eaten by the dogs.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;The bunnies living cage-free meant that we could not pick them up whenever we wanted. Trust would have to be earned. Abe, Sarah, and I spent hours each day luring them out with carrots. From Abe we learned that carrots were good for eyesight. Searching Midnight’s eyes, I felt pleased knowing that she would have the best eyesight in the world given the amount of carrot feedings she was getting. I even stole some bites for myself, knowing that I wanted the same strong eyes.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, at age eleven, it came time for us to move from our little trailer on County Road 384. “The bunnies have to stay. There is not enough yard at the new house for them," Mom explained. The domesticated bunnies stayed behind. She abandoned them, forcing them to learn to survive in unfamiliar territory.

									<h2><i>Josiah in Charge</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;When away from home, Mom always assigned the eldest kid as a babysitter. Because James and Jacob moved out when I was so young, I mostly remember it being Josiah. Sometimes she was “leaving” Dad, other times she was grocery shopping or cleaning rental houses. On this particular day, Mom was running errands.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Okay Kelly, you fold laundry and Josiah you will be doing dishes...” Mom continues down the list. Typically I would beg to go with her, but she has already told me “no” because of chores.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Everyone begins their work prior to her leaving. Then as soon as the door closes, Josiah drops the dish towel and walks toward the living room. “Okay Kelly, go do the dishes.” He is calm, playing out a normal routine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“What?! No! Mom said that was your chore.” I hate when he bosses me around.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Ya but she’s gone and left me in charge. And I’m telling you to do them.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“That’s not fair!” My voice shrieks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya it is. I’m your elder so you have to do what I say.” These were words that Mom drilled into all of us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No. I’m not doing them.” I start to walk away.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What did you just say to me?” His teeth are now clenched.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Suddenly, I am aware of how small I am. But I refuse to lose to him. I try to maintain eye contact. “I said I’m not doing them. Mom told you to.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He grabs my wrist and digs his nails deep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I said. Go. Do. The. Dishes.” His teeth remain clenched while he speaks, and his movements are calculated. He recognizes his power, and his venomous eyes pierce me to the bone.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah stop! You’re hurting me!” I try to pry his fingers off with my other hand. They are too tight.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you going to do the dishes?” He is unwavering and not to be questioned. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But I can’t give in. I can’t show weakness. “No! I’m not doing your dishes!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A grin forms on his face, finding amusement in my lack of control. Then he reaches behind my head and yanks my hair so hard that I wonder if it rips from my scalp.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop you’re hurting me!” I yelp.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I. Said. Go. Do. The. Dishes.” His anger is increasing.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Now I’m scared. I don’t want to be hurt so it’s easier to give in. “Fine, I’ll do the dishes! Just let go. Please Josiah!” Now, I’m pleading.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He releases me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m telling Mom on you though!” I shout while running the opposite direction.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As I storm from the room I hear, “So what? Do it. She won’t believe you anyway.” He lets out a chuckle as he walks to the computer on the other end of the room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dirty dishes line the counters and spread across the kitchen table. Completing this chore feels endless. And, the smell of old food and mildew fills the air making me gag. So, I don’t do them. Instead, I fold baskets of laundry. Josiah is still at the computer when I return to the living room. I am unsure where my siblings are, probably off at friends’ houses, playing outside, or in their bedrooms.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, come here.” Josiah turns to me with a gentle smile. I see the computer screen. It’s what Josiah calls “porn”--something he shows me when he wants to touch me again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Usually, they are videos of men and women engaging in sexual encounters. Other times, it’s two women. One of them will have a fake penis attached to the front of what looks like a belt. I’m confused by this. I had never thought about how women had sex before, but I guess this makes sense.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Josiah, I don’t want to.” Humiliated, I search the area for anyone who might overhear what is happening.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Common’, Kelly, I know you want to. You’re just not in the mood yet.” He approaches me, blue eyes hungry with lust and begins touching in a way that elicits a response. No matter how much I fight it, my body always betrays me with a response of pleasure.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After that, comes shame and disgust. I will run as far away from him as I can get, hoping to disappear all together.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;These events happen whenever Mom isn’t home, or even sometimes if she’s busy in the other room. Which is at least daily. Sometimes he even has me take baths with him or do unthinkable things in the hot-tub. I do what I can to avoid his presence, especially when Mom isn’t home. But hunting is his art and he pounces at any opportunity, excited to devour his prey.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Mom arrives home, I tattle-tell about the dishes, not what Josiah did to me in the back bedroom just moments before. Long ago he explained to me that we would both get into trouble, and since then silence about it has become an unspoken rule. I also work hard to hide it, hoping to bury the embarrassment I feel. It doesn’t make sense to me at the time, I just feel disgusted with myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, Josiah tried to make me do his dishes while you were gone! And when I said no he scratched me and pulled my hair! See, there’s marks all over my wrist!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Josiah, did you do that?” Mom tries to act serious, but we can all tell she doesn’t mean it. She’s tired. These occurrences happen regularly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, she disobeyed me," he responds with confidence.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, did you disobey him?” Her attention is back on me. It feels like a game. One that I don’t know how to win.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Well, ya, because the dishes were his chore!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“And she was disrespectful and got an attitude with me," he chimes in.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! No, I didn’t! He was being mean to me!” I’m losing control of my temper again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, she yelled at me. Just like she’s doing now," he counters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! No, Mom, you have to believe me! I only yelled because he was hurting me!” I want someone to understand the boiling rage in me. There is so much emotion, but I don't scream to hurt anyone or be “bad.” It is too much emotion so I explode. That’s all I know.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But Josiah, what he does is intentional, tactical, and effortless. It makes my rage boil more.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Yet, no matter my efforts, I can’t make Mom believe me. The lack of knowing what to do or how to save myself from the inevitable makes my head spin so fast that I’m losing control all over again. So I scream. I scream loud because it’s what my body needs to do. Then, I feel guilty and embarrassed for screaming. It’s all wrong. Everything is wrong. And scary. And when mom’s not on my side, I’m alone. Alone with no safe space to turn to. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“See how she’s overreacting, that proves that she’s lying. She did get an attitude with me.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I did not! You were hurting me!” No matter how loudly I scream, Mom won’t hear.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Well, Kelly, Josiah is your elder and I did leave him in charge. You disobeyed him.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What, no I didn’t! Mom, it’s not fair! I folded the laundry like you said!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah smirks at me from behind her, satisfied with his victory.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I truly hate him. My muscles tighten with fury but don’t know what to do with it and the powerful emotions are paralyzing. I don’t understand how he could be so nice to me one second and horrendous the next. He enjoys my body, but everything beyond that is meaningless. What makes me feel disgusted with myself, is the only thing that makes him be nice to me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I am even more confused by Mom. How can she take his side when such injustice is occurring? Why do I get punished when he was the one bullying me? Why doesn’t she believe me? It is no wonder that I don’t tell her what he truly does to me while she’s gone: between his threats and her siding with the older sibling and never believing me, I am certain I would have been paddled for his abuse of me. Even worse, she would have roped Dad in for the belt. After, I would have been sent to my room to repent for my sinful behavior of lying or enticing my brother. Or possibly she would do the same thing that she did with Glen: forgive and forget Josiah and turn a blind eye. I was trapped into a lose-lose-lose situation. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;There were times when Mom didn’t always take his side. She was quite unpredictable, making it difficult to know whose side she would choose. Maybe it was who had the better argument. Or maybe it depended on her mood that day. If Josiah had gotten into trouble with Dad recently, she might feel bad for him and take his side no matter what. The same would go for me. It all just depended on feelings and circumstances.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This time, I was the target on the other end of the kitchen paddle.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What, no Mom, please! I didn’t do anything wrong!” I start to run, but remember it’s better if I don’t. Escaping Mom is easy, but then I would get the belt from Dad when he gets home. So instead, I surrender, because the spatula by Mom is a simple sting compared to the thrashing of Dad’s leather belt. Either way, this ends with fresh marks on my bottom to add to the wounds from Josiah on my wrists.   
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah did many things to taunt me like older brothers do, but his taunts were especially cruel. He always delighted when triggering an emotional response. Once when he was in charge, I was famished. We were low on food and I didn’t know how to use the stove.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah, can you make me some ramen noodles? I’m hungry," I beg until he gives in.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He has just drained the noodles from the boiling water when he looks at me with an idea. “Want to see me stick a noodle down my throat and pull it back up?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No!” I exclaim, irritated by his torment.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Watch, I can really do it!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Josiah! Please don’t! I’m begging you! Please!” I squirm in my chair, wanting to leap and scratch his face until he stops. But he’s too strong and will only hurt me. I know that, so I remain seated, unable to follow through.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Watch.” He stares while lowering the noodle into his mouth. When he pulls it out, he places it back into the pot of noodles. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah! I hate you! Why would you do that?” My throat aches from shouting. Tears fill my eyes.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It’s fine," he chuckles. “We share DNA anyway.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he places the bowl of noodles in front of me, I no longer feel hunger, just revulsion. He turns his head and I pour them into the trash.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I thought that he was being “nice” during the sexual abuse, because at least he wasn’t taunting me like with the noodles or pestering or the countless other ways he tormented me over the years. He spoke kindly and used gentle hands when he molested me. He didn’t threaten me and made it seem as if it were a form of play. In retrospect, he was more kind to me during moments of sexual abuse than anyone was in my entire life. Everything felt so confusing.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As a little girl, I didn’t understand that the sexual encounters were abuse--that all of his actions were being used as a way to overpower someone smaller than him. He was so powerless over his own abuser, Glen, that he taunted me and controlled my body to regain some semblance of agency over his life. I wasn’t a person to him; I was just something that filled a deep hole of pain. Yet, I felt like I was something to him. Because he paid attention to me. He was nice. It’s so sad to think back on how the person who showed me the most love, was Josiah, my abuser. I deserved so much more. I deserved better. 
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By the age of six, the sexual encounters with Josiah were already so normal that I began asking questions out of curiosity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Why does it feel good?” I was confused.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know, it just does.” At first, he enjoyed my curiosity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Does it feel good in the butt?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, no.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Why not?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know. It just doesn’t.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Then, my questions became more annoying and difficult to answer. “Why isn’t anyone supposed to know?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Because we will get into trouble” was his usual response.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the abuse continued through the years, I hated myself more. I felt naked the moment anyone’s eyes landed on me. But nothing left me more exposed than when he saw me. Despite Josiah's answers to my questions, I still felt confused. What felt certain was that if it had to be kept this big of a secret, there must be something terribly wrong with what we were doing. I say “we” because as a kid, I felt like a participant, not a victim. He badgered me, but rarely forced me into sexual encounters. Like most abusers, he was more kind and attentive than ever during the sexual abuse. I never once thought he was the one hurting me. Instead, I felt that together, we were doing something wrong. That I was just as responsible as him, if not more. Because I was the one who still gave in knowing how wrong it must be.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One time, as he pestered me, I challenged him: “I bet my friends don’t do it!” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, they all do. Everyone does. They just don’t talk about it.” He rolls his eyes in annoyance.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Does Kathy Brown do it?” I ask this because Mom has been comparing me to Kathy Brown, insisting that I be more like her. “Kathy Brown  is so nice and respectful, why can’t you be more like her? She would never talk back to a grown-up or disrespect her elders like you do.” If Kathy Brown does it, then I do not have to feel as guilty about Josiah touching me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, I bet she does," he finally answers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I wasn’t always alone with Josiah. Sometimes he convinced my sister Sarah and even some of our friends to “play his games”. The young girls in our homeschool community who would go along with him were hungry for attention, validation, and companionship with someone older. And, sadly, there was a lack of accurate education in the homeschool community about how to keep one's body safe. A male pursuing a female was more of a reflection of how the girl must have presented herself in a sinful manner. No blame would be put on a male for his actions. The young girls were set up to be sexually abused and hide in silent shame. Years later I would learn that most sexual abuse comes from trusted neighbors, friends, church members and family members. Yet, in my family, it seemed that sexual abuse wasn’t abuse unless it came from outside the inner circle of family members and friends. Because inside, according to my parents, it was just “child’s play”. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah enjoyed watching girls together, gaining pleasure from providing specific instruction about what he wanted us to do to each other. And we would do it. The need for approval and being valued is so strong in children--especially those who are largely ignored and discounted by parents like many of us were. We would do anything for someone to enjoy our presence, even if it meant learning new, “adultlike games.”
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the tender age of seven years old, Kelsey and I began attempting to pull all-night sleepovers. Seeing who could stay up longer became a competition that I always lost. One cool and dark fall night, we set up the pull-out couch in the addition-room that Dad built onto the trailer. When my siblings came into the room, we pushed them out. They were not allowed into our best friend slumber party. The wood fire stove burned, leaving a warm and cozy feeling in the room. “You have to stay awake all night this time. You have to stay up with me because when you fall asleep then I get bored and fall asleep.” Lying on our sides with a raggedy quilt draped over us, Kelsey was using her serious voice.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I will stay up this time. I really will.” My words were certain, but we both knew that when it came down to it, I could not win a battle against my tired body. On our bed were snacks, beads for bracelet making, nail polish, and a portable compact disc player with headphones. “We have all of this fun stuff and I really think that it will help me stay awake,” I attempted to convince us both.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Kelsey sat up, pulled her fine blond hair into a low ponytail and stuck out her hand. “Okay, but you still have to pinky promise me that you won’t fall asleep tonight.” The deal was sealed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Kelsey searched her CDs: Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and NSYNC. Finally, she settled for Britney Spears latest album <i>Oops!...I Did It Again</i>. Taking turns with the headphones, we chatted while painting our nails.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Colorful nails were forbidden by Mom, as she believed that it was for worldly promiscuous women who sought sinful attention from males. When she was not home, I enjoyed coloring my nails with Sharpie markers, always hiding them from any of my siblings who might tattle on me. The adrenaline rush was a thrill. I could fit in with my friends and the sin did not feel real if Mom did not know about it. I only had nail polish on this occasion after somehow winning a case against her. After pleading with her all throughout Walmart, she caved when I showed her a color so light that it was invisible on my nails. I painted on multiple coats, hoping that if I did enough the faint blue would become more noticeable. This plan partially worked but ultimately, my nails barely appeared any different.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As with most of my friends, Mom thought that Kelsey was a bad influence on me. She attended public school and exposed me to worldly things such as wearing pants, painting nails, popular music, and calling adults by their first names. Our friendship existed solely because Mom believed that I would be a good influence on her. For me, she was my ticket for fitting in with all of the other kids my age. Sure, Kelsey taught me unholy things, but she also kept me well-informed on how to connect with other friends. The lesson that I learned on this night was that all of the kids at public school were spending their recesses outside digging to China in the dirt. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The night dragged on and despite Kelsey’s attempts to keep me awake, we both slept.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Soft crackling noises came from the wood stove and the smell of freshly burnt wood filled the air.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, wake up. Come here.” Uncertain if it was a dream or real, I heard a distant voice whispering my name. When my eyes opened, the light remained on above my head. Josiah stood across the room as a shadow in the hall. A closed half smile formed on his face when he saw that he had successfully woke me. His blue eyes were fierce, not daring to look away from their prey.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Common Kelly, come here!” he continued whispering with excitement while waving me over. He started moving his tongue around, indicating that he wanted to lick me down there. My mind cleared abruptly. I was wide awake. My eyes darted to the other end of the bed and I felt relief seeing that Kelsey was still sleeping soundly. She had not witnessed what Josiah had just done. Jumping from the bed, I held my nightgown down to be sure not to expose myself any more than I already was. Desperate to leave the room before Kelsey saw what was happening, I scampered passed Josiah, down the dark hall, and straight to his bedroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah followed. He sat next to me on the bed and put his hand on my leg. Seconds later, he stood up with an idea. When I realized what he was doing, I chased him down the hall where he was peering around the corner toward Kelsey.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly,” his face turned down at me. He was holding a smile so big that his vampire-like canine’s poked at my nerves. “Go wake her up and tell her to come back here with us," he instructed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?” I paused, looking back and forth between him and Kelsey. Hesitantly, I defied him. “No Josiah… I don’t want to.” I felt humiliated thinking about anyone knowing what Josiah and I had been doing together. I was not about to let one of my closest friends find out. Even worse, I worried she would tell our parents and feared getting into trouble.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Come on, just go wake her up. It will be fun.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he started walking toward her, my hands instinctively grasped at his big hand. “Josiah, please…” I yanked him back into the hall. “I will do whatever you want, just please do not make me go get Kelsey. Please, Josiah.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Whatever I want?” he repeated.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It was settled.
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Days later when Kelsey went home, I headed to the back yard with two kitchen spoons. Determined to get to China before her school friends, I began digging. About one foot into my hole I was keenly aware that the process was taking longer than anticipated. “This is worse than that time I tried to mow the grass with scissors," I groaned to myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It was midday and the fall breeze had shifted to a beaming sun. Moving away from the hole, dirt fell from my jean skirt and my eyes caught a wooly bear caterpillar on a dead leaf beside me. Picking it up, I noticed the tickle as it crawled along my fingers and hand. Thinking it was the kind of caterpillar that turned into a monarch butterfly, I was in awe. Observing it closely, I wondered about the transforming process. It was beyond me how an ugly bug limited to slow crawling, could transform into such a flying beauty with vibrant colors.
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was ten years old when Josiah abused a family friend’s daughter, Caterina. They were both sixteen, but with cognitive delays, her personality was similar to a young girl. Mom forced me to hangout with her, even though I begged not to. I didn’t understand Caterina’s struggles, I just knew that my friends thought she was weird. And I knew that her maturity didn’t match mine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, you are going to stay the night at Caterina Madle’s this weekend," Mom would tell me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! Mom, please don’t make me go! Caterina is weird!” It wasn’t just that I looked down upon her--sometimes we truly had fun together--the issue was that her trailer was farther out in the country, surrounded by fields and rundown houses. It smelled of unwashed clothes, bird poop and stuffy sweat. Her Mom and brother seemed to have the same delays as her. I couldn’t explain it, other than that I felt uncomfortable and out of place there. Thinking back, I now wonder if that feeling was similar to how she herself felt trying to live in a world where her mind didn’t function at the same pace as others. Was she the minority surrounded by people different from her with a longing to belong?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Nope, you’re going and that is that,” Mom reprimanded. “ She has trouble making friends, and I feel bad for her. Being nice to her is what Jesus would want you to do.” No matter how much I argued, I rarely won this one. Mom invited her to our trailer just as much, which was when Josiah had the opportunity to abuse her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;While she may have been cognitively behind, Caterina’s body was not delayed. It was so womanly. I wondered how much longer I would have to wait for such a body. That way I could get married, have kids, and live with a family of my own, leaving this entire life behind. It would be nothing like my family. We would live in an actual house with more space. I would clean regularly, making it smell nice and spend time playing with my kids. I would teach them important lessons and make sure they never went without food. My kids would have a dad who loved them. He would be my best friend, treating me with kindness. It would be safe. I could picture it clearly, but it still felt so far away. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	My body had just begun to change, which might have been what peaked my curiosity. Josiah noticed because he regularly asked me whether I had started my period. Humiliated, I always had the same response “What?! No, Josiah. Don’t ask me that!” At the time, I didn’t know why he was suddenly fixated on my period. It was not until many years later when flooded with memories of penetration that I understood he probably feared me getting me pregnant. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	I wondered if Caterina didn’t feel pain when Josiah put his fingers inside of her because of how developed her body was. Not being that far along, I screamed and cried when he put his fingers in me. “It will only hurt for a minute, just until it’s in. Then it will feel really, really good. Even better than the vibrator.” I always felt lied to when the burning continued after he got inside of me. Fortunately, he wasn’t turned on by my pain and eventually gave up when it didn’t subside. His goal was to trigger a pleasurable response from my body. It almost felt as if he were using me as an experiment, trying to find what would lead my body toward feeling the most amount of pleasure. When that didn’t happen, he found a new course.

										&emsp;&emsp;The basement of this building is sinking in on me. With hands cupped around my eyes, I peer through a door window. Nothing but complete darkness. Suddenly, my body lurches away, certain a zombie or vampire will burst through. My brain knows such things aren’t real, but reacts in fear before it can remember. Those scary movies my brothers watch feel undeniably true. Rushing around the corner, I slip through a curtain and into the bathroom stall with Mom for safety. She will protect me from my imagination.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, it’s just an abandoned pool on the other end of that door.” She hugs and reassures me. “Actually, before Iva’s husband died, everyone used to go in there and swim after bible quizzing!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My mind continues battling between what it has created behind that door, versus Mom’s happy memories. I want her recollection to be true so that my body will stop shivering, but fear feels stronger. At the other end of the bathroom there are three showers, which also have curtains for privacy. It’s like an abandoned locker room, only without lockers. Up the stairs, on the main floor, is a large gymnasium-like structure that will be the site of the evening bible quizzing contest. It is an odd place: part-pool, part-gym, part-home, and I’m not sure if it’s the structure, the people, or the pressure put on me by Mom, but I’m uncomfortable here. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Continuing this tradition since I can remember, Mom brings us to bible quizzing monthly during the fall and winter. Many years before I was born, when my two eldest brothers were in elementary school, they attended a Christian School a few towns over. Mom later pulled them out for homeschooling, but she must have met someone from there who introduced her to bible quizzing. Or maybe it was someone from our homeschool group. Either is likely.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It begins every year when we receive our study pamphlets in the mail, one addressed to each of us kids. Inside of the large envelopes are thirty bible verses for us to memorize. Typically, I would spend hours studying notecards. Sometimes I would pace the trailer with a tape recorder on which I had recorded verses, pausing to finish each one the moment I recognized it--a trick I learned from Chase. The tools are helpful, but rarely get me into the top ten. As a young girl, competing against older kids is impossible. The rivalry is intense and high schoolers with the most outstanding scores receive scholarships. They take this opportunity very seriously.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On the main floor, I wait on the edge of my seat in the aged building that smells faintly of mildew. Six tables line the center of the floor, two adults sitting patiently at each one. I hear the classical version of the old Christian hymn “As the Deer” echoing from speakers set on the tables. I am one of two dozen school-aged children in folding chairs that encircle the vast all-purpose room in the building beside Iva Gilligan ’s house. Soon, the music will cut out and a monotone male voice will echo “this next question is a finish the verse question” or “this next question is a reversal question”.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Wires spread across the chairs, with a rectangular pad resting on each one. When the verse sounds, the first person off their chair steps forward to finish it at the table in front of them. The process is set up like a game show. There are electric boxes on the tables and a light will appear with the first person off their seat. Mom says that Iva’s husband began the bible quizzing tradition shortly before he died and she carries on the practice. But she often needs help so between Mom’s Godly duty and “feeling sorry” for Iva, it is common for us to have stacks of wires for the electrical boxes at home. She clips and files cable chords for the electrical box systems. They need to be done just right to fit the plug properly. A favorite pastime of mine is helping Mom, although I usually don’t file well enough and she finishes my work. Sometimes, irritation builds in my chest as I wonder how she feels sorry for other individuals yet fails to notice her own kids needs, particularly my sadness and loneliness. Regardless, we enjoy the quality time of completing the task together. Helping Mom is how I fill my void.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On the edge of my seat, I wait, hoping to hear “for God so loved…” so that I can jump and finish John 3:16, my favorite verse. The months when this verse appeared on my study sheet were my favorite. I never got it wrong. Reversal questions are the hardest. They begin with the second half of the verse, making it harder to trigger my memory. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once the scores are announced, the parents and youth leaders serve all of the children either banana split sundaes or frozen pizza reheated in the kitchen, located at the other end of the room. My favorite is the pizza months. Consuming this gourmet meal will provide the full belly I lacked all month.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Whether I was at a friends’ house or church, adults made regular comments about how much food I could devour. “You want ANOTHER serving?!” The shock in their faces provoked insecurity in me. I always thought, <i>Abe is right… I do deserve the nickname “Kelly Belly” because I do eat too much</i>. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t have the words to communicate that no matter how much bread, dry cereal, and ice cream I ate at home, I never felt full. To others, the monthly meals were probably similar to late evening snacks. But I couldn’t stop my body from eating at these “all you can eat” dinners. I wouldn’t have known when my nutritional needs would be met again. On nights when banana splits were served, I couldn’t even finish it. Mom was too busy to cook us meals, and rarely kept healthy food around the house, so I would have already eaten a humongous bowl of ice cream as my dinner.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This bible quizzing night will end on a good note. After filling my stomach so full that nothing else will fit, I will be outside breathing in cold Michigan air while studying the stars in the sky--or I might decide to play an outdoor game of tag with friends and siblings. Once Mom is done cleaning up, my siblings and I--or homeschool friends if it is a carpool night--will tell riddles and play the alphabet game until we fall asleep on the thirty-minute ride home. Just like my stomach, my heart will also be content.
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	I’m standing in church, eyes peeking between congregants to see the “worship team”--a group of members leading the church in hymns. We are in a part of Indiana that is surrounded by cow farms, fields, and horse and buggies. Mom’s favorite pastor, Brother Gerald Dolt, will be speaking. He shares many of the same beliefs as Mom and even has around eight children, nearly as many as us, because members of this church do not believe in birth control. Instead, families trust God to choose the number of children that women bear. Women also follow the modest tradition of wearing long dresses, but identify themselves separately from the Amish women in the area. Similar to us, their hair is pulled into tight buns or braids. When left down, it falls past theirs waists. No makeup, no piercings, no nail polish. During the service, the women wear “head coverings,” a thin veil that rests on their head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom adored Brother Gerald so much that when we couldn’t make the three hour drive on Sundays, she gathered us in the trailer for her own little service. Playing her guitar for worship, she would then force us to listen to his long sermons that took up multiple cassette tapes. If we fell asleep on these mornings from being up all night due to lack of structure, we would wake to being repeatedly hit with Mom’s hand or a metal spoon.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In the chapel, most of the congregation would be enthusiastically singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace”, “How Great Thou Art”, or “Lord I Lift Your Name on High” and  a few members would be in a full charismatic trance, praying in tongues.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On this day, worship seems to be taking forever. My legs are aching so I sit on a cheap folding chair behind us, hoping that Mom won’t make me stand again once she notices.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During these services, the pastor would be preaching about how to live righteously. Or he would teach ways to guard our hearts from being tempted by Satan. Mom would listen intently, tuning out everything around her, occasionally bowing her head to pray in tongues. When she was pleased with the sermon, she spoke “Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Yes, Lord," and other words of agreeableness. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My heavy eyes, tired from boredom, are shocked awake when I hear a retching sound. Three seats to my right, Daniel’s rainbow colored vomit spews onto the floor. Vomiting--or seeing others vomit--has always been my biggest fear. Landing in survival mode, I pull my legs into my chest. Eyes squeezing shut, I bow my head into my knees and plug my ears. Still able to hear the gags, I begin a monotone hum loud enough to drown out any noise while tapping my feet repeatedly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once it is over, the physical sensations set in. Feeling nauseated, my hands become sweaty and shaky and I close my eyes in attempts to avoid the tunnel vision.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It looks like an M&M McFlurry from McDonalds. That is all it is. I try convincing myself, repeating these words rapidly in my mind. But my attempts to redirect my thoughts are drowned by the lingering smell of “up-chunk.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The church service continues on while Mom scrubs the floor with bathroom paper towels.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, is Daniel sick?” I whisper, needing to know. I didn’t know what was happening with me at the time, but being around “puke” triggered panic attacks so severe that I feared I’m dying. But if it wasn’t the stomach flu, it wasn’t contagious and my anxiety could calm more quickly. Mom knew that.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Kelly, he just ate too much candy on the drive without having breakfast.” I am not sure if I should believe her. It did make sense that this would be the cause because on those mornings when we traveled to Indiana for our full day of church, filling us with the word of God was a more pressing matter than filling us with a nutritious breakfast.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom would wake us before sunrise to prepare for our three hour trek out of state. Her bright bedroom lights confused my sleeping brain. Unable to fully wake myself, Mom would dress me while half asleep. Most of us would remain asleep in the van when we left, which meant we went without breakfast.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This day, we stopped at a gas station for snacks along the way and Daniel bought a packet of the sour candy, Chewy Sprees. Feeling famished as a four-year-old who hasn’t eaten in fourteen hours would, he gobbled them all down before we arrived. Having nothing in his stomach but candy, it makes sense that he became ill. But my eight-year-old brain could not understand this.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I try to forget about the vomit but can’t. The room is suffocating me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Per usual, church drags on well into the afternoon because Brother Gerald stops preaching only when he feels led by the Holy Spirit, which could last hours. Desperate to make time go faster, I head for the bathroom. Removing my tights is irritating, but I will take as many bathroom breaks as I can if it means speeding the day up. I try reassuring myself: <i>If I’m not puking in three days, then I know it isn’t the stomach flu.</i> I need to keep moving to speed up the service, but also need to make these three days of anxiety go by as quickly as possible. In a few days I would find that Daniel had indeed eaten too many sweets. This time, no other siblings would fall ill to the stomach flu.
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When services ended, the congregation members chatted for hours. During such times, I grabbed packets of sugar that people used for their coffee and poured them into my mouth. It helped soothe my hunger pains. I would watch young mothers feeding their kids healthy snacks, pushing them on swings, or watching them play while rubbing their pregnant bellies. I stared attentively, imagining the day when I would be caring for a baby of my own and disappeared into my thoughts, wishing that I could skip forward into that dream.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By the time we arrived at Pastor Dolt’s for afternoon lunch, my body was usually weak with hunger. They invited other church members on special occasions, but because of how far we had travelled, they mostly only hosted us. Mom typically contributed bread rolls, casseroles, or a crockpot dish and the kitchen always smelled of the best stew. Or maybe it smelled scrumptious because of my extreme hunger. They had the longest kitchen table I had ever seen. Even so, it didn’t fit both of our families and folding tables for us young kids were usually set in another room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After lunch, I would play with Ally, their youngest daughter who was my age. Like proper girls, we spent many hours playing imagination games with her toy kitchen set. When that became boring, we passed time by rotating between challenging each other in Yahtzee and wandering the yard chatting.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My memories of church in Indiana were all similar to this. There were occasions in which they didn’t have a location for holding Sunday services, although I am uncertain why. When this happened, family’s volunteered their homes and we would cram into living rooms. Everything else remained exactly the same. The Cole children would spend most of our Sunday’s half asleep, uncomfortable, confused, bored--and sick to our stomachs--from either hunger or poor nutrition. The message of “How Great Thou Art” was lost in the haze of our needs not being met.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	I recall that when I was around the age of nine, we attended a pentocostal church in Watervliet, a town twenty minutes over. It was another church where women wore long dresses and hair past their waists. Similar to the Indiana congregation, they believed that women needed long hair and dresses to express their femininity and remain modest. These services didn’t go quite as long as the Indiana ones, but we attended regularly for Sunday morning and evening services, and a Tuesday night bible study.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I typically spent services reading “Chick tracts”. These little booklets have cartoon gospel stories in them and are given to people as a form of ministry. The characters in them usually learn of scripture that applies to their life, which leads their hearts to Christ. My favorite one was called “The Little Ghost”. It was about two boys who dressed as a ghost and devil for Halloween. When they attempt to scare a girl, she states that she is not scared. She continues by giving them a lesson on sin, the devil, and Christ’s resurrection, explaining that the devil is scared of Jesus who lives in her heart. I found them much more entertaining than listening to Pastor Elijah's sermons. When I memorized enough of them, I sat back into the pew where I would either nap or practice braiding my hair.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom decided to have us baptized in this church. But, because the small chapel didn’t have a baptism tub, Pastor Elijah met us at another church.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The problem was: Mom knew I didn’t want to get baptized. The times I had witnessed the dunkings frightened me; the pastor would loom over the individual and seemingly force their entire body backward into the tub, water cascading over the sides of the fiberglass fixture. When they disappeared into the water I feared a drowning would occur. These rituals were performed in front of a crowd of clapping and shouting congregants. If I was afraid of leaning backwards in the bath to get my hair washed at the trailer, then baptism was a violent plunging into the unknown.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You have to, Kelly. You have to get baptized to get saved," Mom explained on the van ride there. As she said this, I was flooded with memories of her telling my friends similar things. I always felt humiliated when she preached at my friends, questioning them about whether or not they had accepted Jesus into their hearts. As her daughter, I didn’t have a choice. It was another inconsistency of Moms. She disagreed with the Catholic baptism of babies because she believed that individuals needed to be old enough to decide for themselves. Yet, when it came to her own children, a baptism was forced upon us as we reached an age that would appeal to the Christians in the pentacostal church. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Built into the back of the sanctuary, the tub rested in dark shadows with only one light beaming from a single bulb in the rafters. When my turn came, I stepped into the ice cold water that the pastor struggled to get warm. The coolness made my shaking anxiety even worse. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I now baptize you in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit.” The pastor used the same line that he did with everyone else. When he dunked me back, I felt trapped as if I were being held underwater. My limbs flailed into survival mode, forcing me back up. Shocked from fear and chilled water, my breath caught.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Mom always spoke of the saving power of God. Follow God to get to heaven after death was my understanding. <i>But what about now?</i> I always wondered. <i>Where is God now?</i> The only time I felt safe with God was alone when he hugged me with his presence. Or maybe my mind created that as a survival mechanism. But even in church, my body froze in terror at the hands of Mom’s cold God who accused the mere existence of a woman in her body as a sin. I didn’t feel saved. Instead, I felt embarrassed being forced into an experience that I never wanted. After being dunked, I felt more fearful of her religion than ever. Why didn’t I feel free and whole like I was supposed to?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One week, after a Sunday service, Josiah caught poison ivy climbing trees in the woods behind the church. It quickly spread to his genitals which to me, felt like the best justice for touching himself and others down there so much. God was punishing him. I knew it. But mostly I felt relieved once I learned that Josiah having poison ivy meant he would not be trying to touch me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my disappointment, things returned to normal the moment it healed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sundays were spent learning how to be a proper woman. If a man lusted after me outside of marriage, it was a sin that would damn me to hell and I must figure out what I did to illicit that response from him and then repent. Only if God found my heart to be authentic, would he forgive me. And so on. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Outside of church, I could never escape the demons sleeping beside me at the trailer. Each time something went wrong in my life, I knew it was God punishing me for not standing strong against Josiah. He was the ghost and devil all in one, sent to destroy me. As a Christian woman, I was to trust that God would protect me. But God didn’t protect me. He didn’t even give me parents that would protect me. For me, this confusing battle of feeling comfort in prayer and anger from being a child trapped in such horrific circumstances was the beginning of my crisis of faith. One that would haunt me well into adulthood.

									<h2><i>Trigger</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes we heard stories of neighbors' homes getting robbed. “That’s why we have our guard dogs. They’ll attack anything that comes this way.” Dad prepared for such an event and trained the dogs rigorously, even making sure we knew the commands “Get em!” and “Attack!” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brothers, particularly Abe, took a different approach. When they noticed how hearing stories of break-ins triggered fear in me, it became their new form of torment.  At nighttime, when my parents slept, they enjoyed their moment, tricking me into thinking intruders were at our trailer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One night I rested on the back of the couch watching Chase play <i>Civilization</i>, a strategy video game, on the computer. It was late and quiet, most of my siblings asleep when suddenly, Abe tapped my shoulder.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, did you just see that?” His voice is deliberate as he points to the front door. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“See what?” My mouth goes dry.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Someone just wiggled the handle on the front door. They are trying to break in!” He rushes to ensure it is locked, flicking the outside light on to let them know we are home. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Keep looking, I bet they will do it again.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My eyes focus on the golden handle, refusing to blink.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He gasps, “A shadow just ran across the yard!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Peering out the living room window I don’t see a shadow, but I’m petrified of looking too closely.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Abe! Did you actually see a shadow?!” My voice screeches.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know.” He pauses, “Why?” Another pause and a half smile forms on his face. He is amused. “Are you scared?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I’m not scared!” Suddenly, admitting my fear feels like losing. Giving way to weakness.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Thinking back, I do not know if Abe saw anything or if he used the entire situation as a form of amusement. This was a common thing my brothers did to me, and I rarely knew the difference. It made me feel crazy. If I believed their lie, they taunted me for overreacting. If I didn’t believe and they were being honest, they condemned me for not trusting them. It was a game with no chance of winning.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This night, my fear built. No matter how hard I attempted distracting myself by playing with Legos, returning to watch Chase, or trying to sleep, my eyes instead shifted between the door handle and living room window. Finally, I found myself in Mom’s room--the only place I could feel safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, I’m scared!” I begin to cry.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What happened?” She voices genuine concern, but remains half asleep. This isn’t a new occurrence.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I think someone might break into our house.” My body is shaking.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It’s okay Kelly.” Her tired eyes fall back closed. “If that happens, we just pray and God will protect us.” She snuggles me closely, holding on so tight that I hope she never lets go. I pull her arms close, breathe in the smell of her nightgown and bedtime hand cream, then fall fast asleep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The next day Dad gets out his small, yet impressively heavy cannon. I am unsure how or where he got it, but am certain he took pride in owning this “toy.” It’s not like the big ones I see in his war movies, but I know it’s just as dangerous.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, she still works!” he is laughing with excitement after the first shot fired across the yard. His ear-protection muffs push down his curly brown hair. It is getting long. Mom always tells us of the days back in the 70s when he grew an afro. I wonder what he might actually look like had he allowed it to continue growing, but it seems that since his army days, he keeps it short.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Despite plugging my ears for the cannon-blast, they are still ringing. This thing is loud. “Here, try these! They will block out the sound so your ears won’t hurt.” He is right. The next shot is more enjoyable to watch. It doesn’t occur to me at the time that an eight-year-old child should not have been in the vicinity of a decibel-shattering weapon of war. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Here, I want to show you something.” He finishes with the cannon and directs me to the trailer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Inside his and Mom’s bedroom, he continues, “I heard you were scared of someone breaking in so I want to show you this here.” He lifts his mattress and underneath rests a polished handgun. One of them that he cleans regularly. His voice is insistent, “If anyone ever breaks in you grab this pistol. Here is the clip. It goes in right here just like this. You flip this switch to turn the safety off, cock it, then you point and shoot. You hear me? You point and shoot. It’s as simple as that. You protect yourself. But you want to make sure the safety is off or else it’s not going to do anything and you’re done for, okay?” Dad was never more serious than when he was discussing conspiracies or intruders. He lived in fear of the outside world and prepared for any type of invader.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My mind shifts to all of the times when Mom instructed us not to wake Dad up. If we do need to wake him up, we must do it from across the room in a soft voice. She was right and I only made the mistake of shaking him awake once. He jumped from bed, fist hanging in the air, ready to smash my face in. Luckily, he recognized me before he could seal the blow. Standing here, watching Dad with his pistol under the mattress, I know that I will never be waking him up again. I won’t risk him shooting me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;There is one other thing I know for certain, I will never be using that pistol. Shooting targets with him is one thing, but even if I do muster super-kid human strength for lifting the mattress and cocking the gun, it holds too much power for a young girl to point at another person. I’m a child living in fear and Dad’s way of comforting me is with guns, not hugs. When I see these weapons that can do the most harm, my fear grows until the whole world feels dangerous. 
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
											&emsp;&emsp;And Mom, she’s my sanctuary.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;So much so that when she invested heavily in her relationship with her lifelong friend, Anna, I tagged along, unable to let her out of my sight. Their friendship confused me though, because she had nothing positive to say about her. “You wouldn't believe it. Anna was skinny and pretty in high school but now look at her. She’s so fat! I can’t believe how ugly she is! And she doesn’t ever smile and walks around like she’s better than everyone else. But I guess if I weighed that much I would be miserable too.” Then she would shake her head in disappointment. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But in Anna’s presence, Mom put on her perfectly kind, generous, and Christian face. “It’s so good to see you. I missed you so much. I think of you and pray for you often.” One would never know any of the horrible things she was thinking underneath. Or what type of prayers she might be sending up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom’s most treasured part about her relationship with Anna was her husband, George. Every time she left to visit them, I begged to join and occasionally, she let me. They had several dogs, which left a foul stench in their house. We typically sat on their tan leather couch into late hours of the night. Mom, George, and Anna talked while I remained silent, waiting to return home. Eventually, it got so late that Anna would go to bed, but Mom and George always stayed up talking for many more hours. Inevitably, I laid my head on Mom’s lap to rest, hearing George’s distinct Hungarian accent blending with Mom’s midwest intonation fading into the distance as I fell asleep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One night, I wanted to go home particularly bad. I was so tired. “Mom, please can we go now?” She continued talking to George, not acknowledging that I had spoken. I shook her arm. “Mommmm, I want to go hoooooome. Please can we go home now?” My voice was heavy with tired whines. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“We will leave in just a little while," she responded without looking at me. I felt completely invisible. I knew that I shouldn’t beg too much or it might ruin my chances of her bringing me again. I couldn’t risk that. In a world that was frightening and unpredictable, a place where the apocalypse could happen at any moment, Mom was my only safety line. My eyes searched the old creaky house. I needed something to help time go faster. Going upstairs wasn’t an option. Besides, the stairway looked dark and scary.  Shoving my frustration down, I wandered toward the dogs in the kitchen. Time seemed to slow as I waited for Mom to want to leave until finally, after what seemed like hours, she shuffled me out to the van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The night was dark and my eyes were heavy, but Mom was more energetic than ever. On the ride home she couldn’t stop talking. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know what George told me? He said that Anna doesn’t like sex. Can you believe that? Someone who doesn’t like sex? I can’t even imagine that. What’s wrong with her? I feel so sorry for him. To be stuck in a marriage like that and his wife doesn’t even like sex.” I froze while she continued on for what felt like eternity. At the young age of about eight, I barely knew what sex was. I didn’t associate what was happening with Josiah as sexual abuse. I didn’t have words for it, just feelings and was mortified that Mom was discussing this topic with me. It came with all of the emotions: disgust, embarrassment, confusion, but mostly, a feeling of wanting to disappear. Even worse, I didn’t desire sex. Would people think there was something wrong with me too? The headlights of the van illuminated the way home as I pondered the question.

									<h3>
										Animals VI - Cole Kids
									</h3>
									
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;A casual observer might say that we Cole kids were like feral animals. Without structure or supervision, we were left to our own devices--especially in the summer when most of our time was spent outdoors, dirty, scraped up, and wild with our imaginations. We would build styrofoam rafts and pretend to be stranded in foreign lands. Or we would put on water boots and search for minnows and garter snakes. Deeper in the woods, we built tree forts. We carried boards, nails, hammers--and even a couple old heavy machetes of Dad’s--to whatever tree we had chosen at the time, then set to building. The tree forts were used to play fantasy games where we pretended to be families surviving in the wilderness. My favorite was being at the tree forts alone, disappearing into my imagination. I always brought a machete; its cold metal and heft was reassuring to me. Chopping trees gave a real life effect to collecting imaginary firewood. Other times, I pretended that I was in <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> as Laura Ingalls Wilder. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One particular tree fort was gigantic and better than all of the others. My siblings and I helped gather sticks and logs, but Josiah did most of the construction. Once it was finished, we tied a rope swing up high in one of the branches. We made a loop in the rope for sitting which allowed us to swing off the edge of the fort and into the air.
										<br>	
										&emsp;&emsp;	I recall one day when my best friend, Shannon, came over to play. We were ten years old, but had been free to play alone in these rough woods since we were toddlers and the rope swing was a regular part of our wild adventures.The wind billowed through our long, unkempt hair as we swung between the fort and the trees, the fort and the trees. Our laughter was stopped short when mid-swing, the rope slipped off my bottom and tightened around my torso. My arms and legs flailed and suddenly my diaphragm was squeezed so tightly I could breathe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Kelly, are you okay?!” concern showed on Shannon’s face.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	I wanted to respond. I tried to respond. But air wasn’t getting through. My arms grasped for the rope in attempts to shift my body. I was stuck.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shannon was much smaller than me. Her bones were visible on her fragile body that seemed to have no muscle. She tried to grab my swinging body and when she finally grasped my leg, was unsure how to shift my body to breathe better. I watched her search the area frantically for a solution. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, here! I’ve got it!” She ran for a picnic table next to the tree. Somehow, her little body gained the strength to slide it under me. Standing on the table gave the rope enough slack for me to breathe again. My stomach and chest were in anguish. My limbs shook. But I escaped the rope. Prior to this day, I had so spent many hours swinging by myself on that makeshift rope swing deep in the woods. The only thought in my head was: What if Shannon hadn’t been there?

									<h2><i>Fire and Ice</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sarah and I are playing outside together, waiting for our friend, Olive Vincent, to arrive. It’s a sunny summer day. I am nine years old, wearing a dirty t-shirt and jean skirt that stops halfway down my calves. Under that, I sport long white socks and stained tennis shoes with holes in the toes. I haven’t bathed in days and my unbrushed hair falls down to my waist. I prefer it that way. Mom is always in such a scramble that it throbs when the brush rips through my tangles. When I do it myself, all of the knots go to one place, leaving what Mom calls a massive “rat’s nest” bulging from the back of my head. Besides, it makes my arms too tired, so it’s easier to leave it alone.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Sarah, come here, we can stand on the shed and look!” We are trying to make time go faster while waiting for Olive’s arrival. Beside the two sheds, are four square metal containers filled with cut firewood. We use a log to hoist ourselves onto them. From there, it’s an easy step onto the shed. Daniel, who is just five years old, climbs up with us. Jumping from one roof to the other, we wait for a little blue minivan to appear from down County Road 348.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When they arrive, Olive’s mother, who insists that we call her by her first name, Brenda, walks her to the backdoor of the trailer for drop-off.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Hey Olive! Look at us, up here! We have been playing a game and can even get from this shed to the one next to it!” We share our excitement about being perched on the roof, except Olive doesn’t respond. Instead, she looks worried. This isn’t like her. She usually joins in on the fun. Then I remember that her mom typically isn’t present for our adventures. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Olive uncomfortably runs her hand through her fine brown hair, looks up at her mom and hesitantly explains, “Mom, they aren’t supposed to be up there.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I now see the concern on Brenda’s face. We must look like a bunch of wild animals running around on these roofs. And she wouldn’t be wrong--after all, it was around this time when I had caught my sister’s hair on fire from lack of adult supervision. 
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;There is an old porcelain bathtub in our backyard that we use for bonfires. My brothers ignite them by pouring gas onto the logs and twigs, then tossing in matches. When it’s lit, the monstrous flames brighten the night air. I am mesmerized by the look of the fires blazing coal and flames, which compare to nothing else.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah is fascinated by fire in different ways. One day, he sits at the kitchen table with a lighter. “Kelly, look what I can do.” He moves his fingers quickly through the flames. “See, I can touch fire and I don’t even feel a thing.” He smiles with squinty, mischievous eyes then continues experimenting, even taking the lighter apart and finding ways to make the flame bigger. His favorite trick is when he covers the top of the lighter then yanks his hand away just at the right time to make the flame triple in size. I’m not sure how it works.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One night, we find bags of clothes that Mom has set aside for donating. We figure that since we don’t need them, they can be used for our bonfires. “Watch this.” Josiah pulls a big coat from the bag and hangs the back of it in front of the fire until it catches flames. Wrapping the coat around his back,  he runs in circles cheering. The flames spread quickly and he makes a game of it by dropping to the ground and rolling the fire out. He stands up and stomps out the remaining flames. “Well, that was a close one!” he laughs with amusement. It is now that I realize how much my chest has tightened. Finally, I laugh a sigh of relief that it is over.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When the flames dim, we fill drinking cups from the house -- which are old yogurt containers -- with more fuel from Dad’s gas can. The fire radiates the moment the vapors touch the surface. Once, I made a trip for gas and returned with excitement as my siblings were blowing on the fire in efforts to keep it going.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Everyone get back!” I shout.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Everyone backs from the fire immediately, except for Sarah, whose face remains by the heat when I impulsively fling the gas from the cup to the fire.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She sees it coming and abruptly turns to avoid the flames but her entire head of hair lights from the back. Fortunately, it burns out quickly before it reaches her scalp.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Silence is drowned by wailing, then a jog to the trailer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My siblings return to socializing at the fire, but I chase her. “Sarah, wait! I’m sorry! Please don’t tell Mom and Dad!” I feel frantic, fearing what beating might await me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In the kitchen, I feel horrified by what I see. Luckily, she is not in pain, but her wiry broken hair sticks out in every direction. Tears cause the dirt on her face to smear. Thinking back on this incident with her raggedy outfit after a day of play, I picture her as Pigpen, the character from Peanuts. After days and weeks without bathing or changing her clothes, dust and dirt trailed closely behind her. Her hair smoking and breaking off as she limped into the kitchen completed the image of an unkempt and uncared for child.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh my gosh, what happened?!” Mom shrieks and runs to her side.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The smell of burnt hair is stinging my nose. “Mom, please don’t tell Dad! Please don’t tell him! I will take whatever punishment you have, just please don’t tell Dad!” I fear his wrath more than anything in the world.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A typical punishment for such a reckless mistake would have been a whipping by Dad’s leather belt followed by being sent to my bedroom until further notice. Thinking back, it doesn’t make sense why we were left unsupervised with bathtub bonfires and gallons of gasoline for so many summer nights. It makes even less sense that when something went wrong due to their neglect, we were the ones punished. It was rare that our parents kept track of what we were doing or where we were. Thinking back, I find it confusing that we, as children, were expected to have the sensibilities of adults and brutalized if showing poor judgment.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I have forgotten the remaining memories from that night; I don’t know whether she beat me with a spoon or not; my only concern at that moment was an immense feeling of guilt that I may have harmed my sister. It seems as if my memories of that night burned away, as if merely existing would be too painful.
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For Brenda, now that she has seen our true wild selves, will Olive still be allowed over? Or will she be like all of my other friends' parents who don’t let them visit our trailer?  Suddenly feeling embarrassed, I attempt to resolve the situation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Alright guys, get down! We have to get down! We shouldn’t have come up here.” Sarah and Daniel follow as instructed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my relief, she still allows Olive to stay. But only for a few hours. After that, we will persuade our parents to let Sarah and I stay the night at her house.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We had met the Vincent's just before I turned nine. Josiah must have met Aiden, Olive’s brother, through mutual youth group friends and they became fast friends. By this time, Aiden came over daily to ride quads, have paintball wars, and light bonfires in our bathtub out back. He introduced us to his two younger sisters, Valerie and Olive. I was initially close to Valerie, but with a four-year age gap, our friendship didn’t thrive. Instead, Sarah and I both became best friends with Olive, who introduced us to Harry Potter and alternative rock music while sporting choke necklaces.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She had visited our trailer a few times, but we preferred to stay at her house. It was much bigger and we could play with fewer interruptions from little siblings. Plus, she had a pool.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Enjoying Olive’s house more frequently worked well, particularly because after the shed incident, I got the impression that her parents were skeptical about our parent’s ability to supervise all of us. She never stayed long after that and when we invited her, she responded similarly to many of our other friends. “Actually, what if you came over here for a sleepover instead?” Although I felt embarrassed that my friends’ parents never allowed them to be over, I enjoyed spending time at homes where food was provided and we were never left to our own devices.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sarah, Olive, and I begged the parents to let us stay as many nights as possible. But even when we weren’t begging, Mom rarely showed up on time to pick us up. “I’ll come pick you girls up at 10am!” She would tell us. When she didn’t show, we would call her. Sometimes she answered, but we usually had to call for hours before she would pick up the phone. At that point, she would explain “Sorry, I had more to do today than I thought! I’ll be there in about two hours.” This routine would repeat until eventually, she showed up--sometimes not until the next day or even more days.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Even then, Brenda always made sure that we were accepted, safe, and loved. Yet somehow I still felt guilt and embarrassment. I didn’t understand why Mom proved different from other mothers. I loved and missed her anytime I wasn’t with her, but a deep part of me knew that if I were born into the Vincent's family, being cherished and cared for would be all I would know. Feelings of bitterness were followed by shame for not being born to parents who truly wanted me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Let’s go in the pool!” We always agreed first thing when arriving at Olive’s house. Sometime after my near drowning experience, mom enrolled us younger kids into swim lessons and Olives pool was our favorite place to put the skills to use. Her home was also in the countryside, but was a large, tidy white farmhouse. They had a lot of property, though not quite as much as us. In the back, a little ways down a path in the woods, there was a barn and tractors, but much farther back, was a big maple tree with a tire swing hanging from one of the branches. My favorite thing in the world was when Brenda joined our bike ride down the dirt path appearing delighted to push us on the swing when we reached the end. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Wait, before you get in the pool let me braid your hair!” Brenda always insisted that braids stopped our hair from getting tangled. I loved when she did my hair. No matter how many tangles I had, she was so gentle that it never hurt. When the knots got bad, she had a special “detangle” spray to make it easier. I secretly wished Brenda could be my mom. Her soft touch reminded me of Grandma Reeds’ back scratches at Christmas. She always did my hair in the living room with their wood fire stove, providing a calm feeling that nearly put me to sleep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Without my mother around, I was allowed to wear my one piece swimsuit with no modest t-shirt or long tank top to cover up--which made it so much easier to swim. It also allowed me to feel less different from my peers. Sometimes, Olive even let me borrow a bikini swimsuit. In the pool, we would have fun games like rating each other's cannon balls off of the deck.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“That was a ten!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, your splash wasn’t big enough, I’m going to have to give you a three...” We took the ratings very seriously.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When we got bored from that, we performed dolphin shows. Our dolphin shows were the best. We twirled in the air, jumped through hula hoops, and flipped in the water. Once we perfected our routine, Brenda and Ron, Olive’s dad, would watch our show. They shared our excitement, rated who had the best performance, and gave a staggering round of applause. When too many hours had passed, Brenda would call us inside for a freshly prepared meal. My favorite was tomato soup and grilled cheese, although I loved her mashed potatoes and chicken too. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During our breaks from the pool, Brenda would join us on bike rides down the West Haven trail. The trail is over thirty-four miles, spanning from downtown West Haven all the way to Kingston. Olive’s grandparents lived across the street and their backyard connected to the gravel trail. We never went for more than a few miles, but we enjoyed cruising through the tunnel of trees, occasionally stopping to explore paths in the woods. Brenda always insisted that Sarah and I wear a pair of Olive’s jeans rather than our long skirts, which were easier for outdoor playing. If we were going on a long ride, she made sure we all brought water bottles and snacks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It felt so nice to have a mother figure who enjoyed spending time with us. I also loved that we never had to worry about food. She fed us--even when we were having too much fun to remember to eat. We spent so much time at the Vincent's that Brenda even bought Sarah’s and my favorite foods, like dill pickles, kettle corn, and cheesy hotdogs. We always ended the day with another dip in the pool and especially loved the occasions when Brenda lets us swim after dark. After the swimming, she would detangle and re-braid our hair.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall one time after swimming I got a bad earache from a buildup of water.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You keep holding your ear, Kelly. Does it hurt?” Brenda notices before I do. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, kinda. There’s a bunch of water stuck in there.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she goes to the bathroom for ear drops, I panic.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I don’t want the ear drops!” My arms tremble as they cover my ears. I hate the tickle of the drops sliding into my ear and the muffled sounds that follow. It makes me worry that I am going to lose my hearing, but I can’t verbalize that yet. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“This is to help. It will stop you from getting any ear infections,” she assures me. We have been through this before and she is always patient with my fear. When I ask, she gives me space and doesn’t force it. Unless the irritation worsens--then she soothes me while gently holding me down to get the ear drops in, providing reminders that I am safe.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As a child, I quickly noticed how Brenda’s parenting was different from my mom’s. She played board games and worked on puzzles with us. With her joining on many of our adventures, I knew that she genuinely enjoyed spending time with us. She was in tune with our needs to a depth that we hadn't experienced. Besides caring for earaches and tangled hair, she bought us toothbrushes to keep at their house because we always forgot ours. She also made sure we showered everyday, especially on days when we swam.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was surprised when she taught me about seasonal allergies. Previously, I thought that my sneezing, congestion, and itchy face were normal. Sometimes I rubbed my nose so hard that it bled profusely, yet I still couldn’t get rid of the itch. I had not considered the possibility of living without the symptoms. Each time I was at their house, she gave me Benadryl and taught me how it would help my body feel better. And it did. Not only that, she noticed when the medicine was wearing off before me and always approached with another pill.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She also helped me overcome my fear of losing teeth--a deep anxiety that began at the age of six when I lost my first tooth.
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I am standing in the living room, showing Dad my wiggly tooth. It is my first one and I am excited for this milestone that will put me closer to my brothers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“That thing still hasn’t come out yet? Look at it, the tooth behind it is already growing in! It’s gotta come out. Here, let me get it.” His voice is rough and his normally blue eyes are dark with irritation. I notice the bitter smell of beer. As Mom would say, he’s drunk.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Suddenly, I’m scared. If it were anyone else helping me, I might feel calmer. But I don’t trust my father. I start to pull away but he holds me tightly, restricting my movement. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Common, sit still wouldya! It’s gotta come out or else your teeth are gonna grow in all crooked! Dammit, I can’t grip it!” He wields a paper towel for extra grip. When it doesn’t work, he directs me to the bathroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Lemme get a better look at it.” He sits me on the cold chipped countertop. “Ya, it’s still stuck in there. You know what some people do, when their tooth is stuck? They tie a string to the tooth and the other end of the string to a doorknob, then they slam it shut and the tooth yanks right out.” I observe his mustache as he lets out a hoarse laugh. “What do you think Kelly, should we do that?” His face softens, as if genuinely trying to make a joke.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My entire body tenses. I don’t find it funny.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Wait here, Kelly, I have a better idea. And don’t move around. I don’t need you falling off the sink.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He returns with a tool that he calls “pliers”. Suddenly, the experience of losing my first tooth is no longer appealing.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Dad, I don’t want to! I want to leave the tooth.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Kelly, it’s gotta come out!” He grips my body so tight that even the trembling muscles are trapped. When the pliers yank the tooth, my gums gain a tingling sensation so strong that will return for years to come when remembering the incident.
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Years later, when Brenda notices my loose tooth, she doesn’t force it out. Instead, she says, “Oh, please can I pull it? It’s hanging right there so close!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, it’s going to hurt!” I let out a screeching whine. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, can I at least wiggle it? That will help it come faster and it won’t hurt.” When I say no, she lets me be and checks back in again later, trying to catch me when I’m calm. Eventually, I trust her enough to wiggle and yes, even pull it. Then, I trust her on more than one occasion with this rite of passage.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Without knowing it, Brenda was opening my eyes to what it could be like to get the love and attention that I craved from a parent. I felt safe in ways that I never thought possible. At the same time, I noticed an emptiness. This emptiness knew that no matter how many days Mom left us there, forgetting to pick us up, Brenda would never truly be my parent.
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The Vincent's home wasn’t the only place that Mom left us for long periods of time. For many years we received piano lessons at Grandma Williams’. She lived alone just across town and her house was the cleanest one I’d ever seen. I felt like I was sinning just by sitting on her clean couch with my dirty clothes. Glass China dish sets and dolls were on display throughout different parts of the house and I feared that breathing might damage the perfect presentation of her home.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She and my grandpa divorced many years before I was born. Sometime after that, she married Jay Williams, a dentist, who died when I was two years old. Although she dated, she spent the remainder of her life living alone. Gram was known for her singing talent and spent her younger years performing in operas. As she got older, she began teaching voice and piano lessons--even to her grandchildren.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, do we have to go to piano lessons?” my siblings and I groaned every week.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Each time we complained about going to our gram’s, Mom’s response was the same. “Piano is a good thing to know and it’s free! Also, it’s good for you to spend time with Gram.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t understand why mom cared about us spending time with Gram because she didn’t bother spending time with us after our thirty minute lesson. Also, Mom and Gram rarely got along. They fought over many things, a big one being that Mom felt like she didn’t spend enough time getting to know her grandchildren.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t feel like Gram enjoyed our visits. It seemed like she gave us free lessons because it was the nice thing to do, rather than because she wanted to. She often accused me of not practicing, even when I did. And worse, once Mom dropped us off we never knew when she would return. Most weeks, my siblings and I fell asleep watching Nickelodeon on the couch while Gram continued teaching other students. When dizziness from hunger set in, I wandered into her kitchen and snuck handfuls of crunchy uncooked spaghetti noodles from the jar on her counter.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes, Grandma Williams’ treatment toward us led to tears. “I try so hard and you kids never practice! You need to practice! I do not know how many times I tell you! PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE! You never listen to a thing I say!” Grandma would shout.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom said that Grandma was nicer to our other cousins than to us and always stepped in for our defense, scolding her for speaking negatively about us. The scoldings always escalated. One argument got so bad that Gram chased Mom out to the van. As she ran back toward her house she slipped and fell on the sidewalk. Instead of helping her or making sure that she was okay, my mom, along with us kids, laughed uncontrollably.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“That’s what she gets. Her falling is God punishing her for being so mean to us!” Mom was crying with amusement.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom also regularly left my younger siblings and me at my aunt and uncle’s for extended periods of time. We enjoyed Aunt Katie and Uncle Ryan’s more because we had our two cousins, James and Nolan to play with. Aunt Katie’s hair salon was in her basement, leaving the fresh scents of hair products throughout the house. Her home was also much cleaner than our trailer. Although, not quite as spotless as Gram’s. Even at a young age, I noticed these things. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We spent most days playing Mario Kart on their Nintendo 64. When I became bored of this, I played in her hair salon, one of my favorite activities that she trusted me with. After all, she did refer to me as the daughter she never had. Although not every experience was positive, spending time at others homes provided me with insights about the world that I might have never experienced being cooped up in the trailer. A world where life could be clean and organized, individuals would feel safe, and love was provided.

									<h2><i>Grandpa Smith</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, do you have to go? Can’t you stay here with us?” My throat aches as I force my tears in, trying not to have another one of my emotional breakdowns. It is nighttime and my voice echoes through a vacation rental home with polished oak flooring and minimalist furniture. I am eight years old and Mom just told me that her father had a stroke. She will leave for a three week trip to Georgia with her sister tomorrow morning, and I am terrified of being left behind.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Kelly, Grandpa Smith is really sick. I have to go be with him.” Her long black hair is pulled into a tight bun and home-cut bangs fall on her face. She moves the broom quickly across the floor. It is late and she wants to get the cleaning done quickly for the next renters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I can no longer hold the tears. My mind is unable to separate the times she has suddenly abandoned me from this planned trip. Even worse, I dread being in Dad and Josiah's care for three weeks. “But I don’t want you to go. Can’t I come with you? I promise I will be good. You won’t even know I’m there.” Feeling a lack of control, my entire body trembles with anxiety.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She stops and approaches at the sound of my tears. Her face shows exhaustion, yet empathy and genuine concern. “Kelly, I don’t get it. I’ll be back in three weeks.” We have had this same conversation on repeat for over an hour. “I don’t know how to help you feel better.” She hugs me, but I cry harder. I know that even the biggest hug won’t make up for the fact that she will be gone the next morning. Thinking back, this is one of the times when I truly felt she saw my feelings.  And she was honest about not knowing how to help. I wished that were enough to make her stay.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The next morning in the trailer, she assures me. “You can call me everyday, whenever you miss me and we will talk on the phone.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Promise? Please Mom, you have to promise!” I need to hear the words.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I promise," she responds.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I sob when she leaves and for many hours in the days that follow. To my surprise, she answers most of my calls, even if it is just for a brief check in. But each time we hang up, I break down all over again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brothers hate it. “Kelly, just stop crying already. You’re always overreacting. It’s not that big of a deal.” I don’t know if I want to hurt them or be comforted. Maybe both. Their words scream that something is wrong with me, tapping into the deep-rooted shame I already feel. I did not yet hold the perspective that my mind and body were having normal reactions to abnormal living conditions.   
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly after Mom’s return, Grandpa moves into our tiny trailer bringing the residents up to ten people. Previously, he lived with his late wife and Mom’s two half-siblings, Uncle Chris and Aunt Stacy, but for now he will be cramped into a trailer with two adults, several flea-bitten pets, and seven kids between the ages of eighteen and two-years old.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We all knew that Mom didn’t like Grandpa. Something about him not being a “nice person”. Much later in life, I will learn that Mom held the trauma of him abandoning her to start a new family. But she never talked about that. There was just tension. You see, as an adult, I have gotten to know Uncle Chris well. It is interesting to share stories, trying to put complex family pieces together. His understanding is that Grandpa was physically and verbally abusive toward Mom and her five full siblings.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Uncle Chris recounted to me that one day, when Mom was a teenager, her father suddenly moved across the country and was quickly remarried to his mother. Around this time, Grandpa turned from the Catholic faith and became protestant. He spent the next years in Washington, studying at Regent College, a graduate school of theology in British Columbia, Canada. Something about this transformation had a healing effect, which helped him care for his new family with a depth of compassion that he didn’t for his first one. As an adult, I wonder if these experiences swayed Mom away from the Catholic faith and piqued a special interest in other forms of religion. Her abandonment of the Catholic faith and adherence to other forms of spirituality feels similar to Grandpa’s own religious quest, except she lacked certain critical thinking skills which allowed her to be swayed into following whatever leaders preached, becoming particularly fixated on doomsday prophets. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom’s relationship with Grandpa changed after he had a severe stroke. During this time, his late wife had also become ill and was too sick to care for him, which is when mom and her siblings brought grandpa back to Michigan. I don’t remember him before he came to live with us, but with his college degree, love for reading, and impressive chess skills, he was described as incredibly smart. Sadly, his stroke took all of that and more--he lost his writing skills, word comprehension, and had restricted movement. When he finally rehabilitated beyond a wheelchair, he still needed his cane to help him around. This is the Grandpa that I knew: the one constrained to a sick body with a dwindling quality of life.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It wasn’t easy for him or for the family who was ill-equipped to care for him. He would take turns living with us, then my Aunt Betty’s, and then Uncle Ryan’s, staying in one place until that household couldn’t handle the stress of him anymore, then he would move to the next home. At our trailer, he camped on the pullout couch in the living room but I don’t remember him staying long, maybe because of our crowded conditions.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom would say that he got nicer after his stroke, although he did still occasionally raise his voice and criticize her. “No, Penny. What are you doing? Stop! I said get my checkbook.” His words were choppy, struggling to form coherently. Sometimes he tried to say one word but another came out. His muscles tensed as his brain searched for the correct word but couldn't find it. When he spoke to her like this, it reminded me of how Dad treated others.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom usually responded with, “No, Dad, you’re not understanding. We can’t write a check because of...” and continued explaining whatever miscommunication they were having. She spoke slowly, emphasizing each word to help him understand. When these conversations circled enough times, she wrote it down for him. Although holding a pencil and writing was difficult, reading was Grandpa’s best form of communication.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, he recovered enough to move into an assisted living facility near downtown West Haven. Mom and her siblings were constantly managing his finances, diet, medication, shopping, and appointments, which meant that we spent a lot of time in his small smoke-filled apartment. Smoking in the apartment was against the rules, but that didn’t stop him from puffing his pipe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My little siblings and I usually plopped onto his bed and watched the Disney channel for hours while Mom was distracted with Grandpa. She didn’t like Disney programming because of the magic so whenever she entered the room, we quickly switched the television to Nickelodeon.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On his bedroom walls were posters of women in bikinis, including a calendar featuring near-naked supermodels. This made me feel sick, but at the time, I couldn’t put words to it. Thinking back to this time when I was only nine or ten years old, I recall that every time I saw those posters, I pictured Grandpa masturbating to these women. It left a gut-wrenching feeling of him being similar to Josiah. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It became routine for Mom to say: “You guys need to get to know your Grandpa better. It’s good for you to spend time with him. And besides, he could use the company,” then leave us at Grandpa’s for extended periods of time--sometimes sleepovers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At first staying at Grandpa’s was novel, which made it fun. But this passed quickly until soon I would be whining, “But Mom, it’s boring over there! I don’t want to go.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You have to. I said so, and that’s final. If you ask him nicely, maybe he will take you to the movie theater.” His apartment was within walking distance from the old movie theater, and he did enjoy going to the movies with us. The only other thing he enjoyed was playing chess. He was so committed that he attended a chess club at the local Burger King every Tuesday night. His face had involuntary movements--perhaps from a medication he was taking--so as he focused on the chess board, his face and mouth would twitch and move in a way that is similar to what I now know to be tardive dyskinesia, a condition caused by taking psychiatric medications. But at the time, I knew nothing about his medications or the game of chess, so I watched people quietly play while waiting for the endless nights to finish. I knew that when he bought me a meal, it would be worth it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Unless we wanted to join Grandpa in a game of chess, he rarely engaged with us. Talking was difficult for him, and he had even more trouble understanding what we were saying. We could write notes back and forth but there wasn’t much to say. Typically, we would all do our own thing and he would gesture to us when he needed help with something like laundry or cleaning. Even at Grandpa’s, I was ignored and the only people showing me attention were the ones wanting something from me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom leaving us at Grandpa’s was similar to any other time she left us: promising to be back at a certain time and arriving multiple hours late. It felt like she used him as an excuse to get us out of her presence. It seemed that we overwhelmed her, so she needed every bit of space away from us that she could get. It may have appeared to her or anyone else that she was simply dropping us off at a family member’s, but it was more than that: I never knew if I was going to be abused by someone. I never knew if she was going to return. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her continued abandonment fed an emptiness in me--a black hole of fear that manifested in severe anxiety complete with physical symptoms such as muscle tremors, nausea, ruminating thoughts and staring off into space, creating feelings of complete disconnection from the world around me. What my siblings and parents labeled as drama, was actually complex trauma. My brain and body doing the best it could given horrific circumstances.

									<h3>
										Animals VII - Guinea Pig
									</h3>
									
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;Our guinea pig, Miss Piggy lived a long life, although I did not connect with her the way that I did the other animals. She lacked softness and hated to be held. So much so that she would bite on occasion. My connection to her came simply from the consistency she played in my life. Her presence provided normalcy.
											<br>	
											&emsp;&emsp;As she aged, her fur began to disappear. It started so slowly with what we thought was just shedding. Weeks later, bald patches appeared on her body. “She must have cancer!” My siblings and I all agreed. Her death lasted for what felt like years, but was probably only months. She was no longer her active self but spent each moment lying in the same spot. Her sickness progressed to the point that we all felt relief when death freed her from the pain.
											<br>	
											&emsp;&emsp;I have since read about why guinea pigs might lose their hair, and it appears the primary cause is from a parasite that can be easily treated. There is no way of knowing whether this was the cause of her death, but if it was, it seems that her life could have been easily spared with common medical intervention.

									<h2><i>The Old Rugged Cross</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;In addition to piano and voice lessons, Mom also signed me up for violin lessons. One of the homeschool families had a high school-aged daughter who was offering them for just $10--and by the time I was nine, we carpooled with homeschoolers the forty-five minutes to another town, where we participated in West Michigan’s Homeschool Band and Orchestras.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Carpooling with the Snyders made for my favorite Wednesday trips to orchestra. I did this each chance I got while my siblings rode with their other homeschool friends. Sophie Snyder, with beautiful shoulder-length brown hair and deep brown eyes, was my closest homeschool friend at the time. When her mom drove, we pretended to be spies. “That person has the same sunglasses as our suspect! We can’t take our eyes off of them!” We documented such clues in little notebooks that her mom bought us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I was around eleven years old, the Snyders suddenly pulled up stakes and moved to another state ripping my dear friend Sophie out of my life. I later learned that her stepdad had fallen into a very serious religious cult, which prompted the move. Luckily, her mom escaped with she and her sister. Sophie recounted to me as an adult that it was a traumatizing experience where their lives were at risk. Fortunately she and her sister now live a mainstream life caring for their own families. It seems that the outer fringe of homeschooling and evangelical churches often attracted people prone to zealousness to the point of falling into cults and conspiracy theories. Years later my own mother would drag her children half a world away to follow her own cult-leader. Such is the life of many children whose parents fall prey to madness cloaked in religion.
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I have no idea how Mom afforded to enroll four children into this musical program with the Snyders, but my guess is that she participated in a financial assistance program. The building was huge and upon entering, the tuning and practicing of instruments filled the halls from different “classrooms”. It felt like an exotic place to me. Some families wore long dresses and donned long, modest hair similar to the females in our family while others were sporting worldly low-cut shirts and tight jeans. It was a special treat to be part of a formal educational program with so many people.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Chase and Abe played the saxophone in the band while I joined the orchestra and choir. One year, Mom even let me participate in color guard. This was extra special because I got to join the Marching Band trip to Washington DC where we marched in the Independence Day parade. On Wednesdays, we fit in with the picture-perfect homeschool group. Any other day, life returned to normal with the Cole kids riding “quads” unsupervised, struggling to get food, and being left home alone for long periods of time.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As our music skills improved Mom dragged us to a nursing home in West Haven where we would perform for the residents like an unpolished, evangelical Von Trapp family. The dining room was cleared and staff helped fill the room with elderly folks who were excited for visitors. Mom  strummed her guitar, singing her high-pitched lungs out, sometimes losing herself in an unexplained coughing fit, while we kids mumbled through old church hymns such as “Little by Little,” “Lord I Lift Your Name on High”, “Amazing Grace”, and “The Old Rugged Cross”. When Mom needed a break from singing, we took turns on our own instruments--the piano, saxophones, and violin. Although performing in front of people felt embarrassing to me, I believe Mom was right: there was something uplifting in seeing how music helped the elderly folks come to life. Some swayed with smiles, seemingly admiring our youthfulness and innocence. Others closed their eyes and sang along.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During this time, Mom’s physical health took a drastic turn. Or maybe it had always been bad and I was just noticing. On weeks when she drove us, she slept in the minivan for hours while we attended our music classes. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, ouch. I don’t feel good guys. I am going to have to pull over and rest,” she often said on the drive home while digging her hand into her abdomen in efforts to stop a sharp pain. I recall times of her leaning back in her seat and groaning in pain for hours while waiting for it to subside. It seemed to get worse after she ate--which was usually pizza, fast food, or Chinese food on those busy Wednesdays. Many years later, she became so sick that the emergency room couldn’t be avoided and from my recollection, they discovered it was her gallbladder. She briefly took medication, but if I remember correctly, she declined the doctor’s orders to have it removed at that time.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom began showing other medical maladies of which she wouldn’t seek medical attention. Her legs and arms regularly became tingly. When this happened while she was driving, whoever was in the passenger seat took over the wheel while Mom shook her arms out, waiting for the feeling to return before she would retake the wheel.  What made matters worse was that she had always had poor eyesight and was not supposed to drive without glasses. But, she would drive all of us kids--and our friends--around anyway. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t need glasses. I am trusting that Jesus will heal my eyes!” she always insisted with confidence and glee. But her eyesight was worsening so that person riding next to her not only had to occasionally steer, they also had to point out stop signals and street signs. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall that sometimes her words would suddenly slur, as if she were drunk. Although, to our knowledge, she didn’t drink during those years. Her strange symptoms were a mystery to us children, but she refused to see a physician, believing that God would cure her. To my knowledge, He never did.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her health deteriorated so quickly that she began a regimen of what I think was “Nutritional Intravenous Therapy” at an “alternative healthcare” facility a few towns over. I do not know much about the two-hour treatment, other than that Mom said it was “all natural vitamins”. The boys were in band class during this time, so Sarah, Daniel, Avalon and I would color pictures in the van or did schoolwork in the chairs beside Mom while she had her mysterious IV treatment. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Despite her constant “dieting” and seeking natural remedies, her weight increased drastically and the dark bags under tired eyes revealed that she was still exhausted after hours of rest. I would later learn that her symptoms might be related to Type 2 diabetes, but at that time, she refused to seek medical attention.  After weeks of the “vitamin treatment”, she received no further care for her illness. Instead, she trusted that God would heal her body but ultimately, remained extremely sick.															
										<br>
										</p>


										<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, wake up," Avalon nudges me repeatedly. “Kelly, help me!” she shrieks louder. I begin to wake, realizing that she is in tears.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Avalon, what is it?!” I don’t know whether I am irritated from being woken up or worried by her tone. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She climbs onto my lap before I can sit up. “Snakes! There are snakes everywhere! Kelly, help me!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? I don’t see any.” My eyes search the shadowed floor but find nothing aside from toys and blankets.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Right there!! Kelly, get rid of them!” Her blonde wavy hair hangs just above her shoulders and rosy cheeks are wet with tears. Burrowing her face into my chest, she attempts escaping the fear. She points, but I see nothing. Her fear and tears are real, she must see something. Is this a bad form of sleepwalking? 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Here, I’ll take you to Mom,” I say.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She tightens her arms and legs around me when I attempt to stand her up. Then she screams louder, “No Kelly! They are on the floor!” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The tension in my head aches from not knowing what to do. My body is heavy, longing for more sleep. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Here, I’ll carry you.” She’s four years old now, making it difficult for my small body to carry her. When I make it across the room to the kitchen, I can’t do it anymore. “Avalon, you’re sliding. I can’t hold you.”She stands but refuses to let go of my hand. The dim sink light is on, making the floor more visible. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“See, no snakes.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, they are gone now," she sighs in relief.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, I’ll walk with you to Mom," I say, squeezing her hand.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One step forward and she leaps back into my arms. “Kelly, the snakes are back! They are all over the floor!” She cries.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mustering every ounce of strength in me, we wobble to the bedroom at the end of the hall.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, wake up!” I whisper.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, what is it?!” Hearing the concern in my voice, she and Dad jerk from their pillows.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Avalon’s cries continue. “It’s Avalon! She keeps saying there are snakes on the floor but there’s nothing there! I tried to set her down in the kitchen because she said they went away but they came back and she won’t stop crying!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh no, come here Avalon.” Mom pulls her into bed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad, who had stepped out to use the bathroom, has returned. “Okay Kelly, go back to bed," he commands.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I pause, wondering if they understood what I told them. <i>Did I explain it right?</i> My body strains with worry and I long for comfort, but I don’t dare question Dad. I turn and leave.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When morning hits, I rush to Mom’s room to check on Avalon. Dad left for work hours before but she and Mom lie in bed chatting.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, how’s Avalon?! Is she okay?!” My body feels jittery with anticipation. Why had Avalon seen stuff that wasn’t there?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh yes, she’s fine!” Mom giggles and lacks concern. “She just has a fever. It must have gotten so high so quickly that she started hallucinating, but she is fine now.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Feeling relief by Mom’s lack of concern, I belly flop next to them on the quilted pink comforter that Mom had sewn. It is thin and worn, but feels like home.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I feel better. I still see things but I’m not scared," Avalon explains.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, is she going to be okay?” Among all of the fevers my siblings and I suffered throughout the years, never had I seen someone hallucinate.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, it’s just the fever. They cause hallucinations sometimes but she will be fine.” Her confidence reassures me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh ya,” Avalon looks amused. As she sits up, I observe that she is regaining her energy. “There’s a bee on your face.” Her dimples flash through a smile.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My parents didn’t give us medicine when we were sick. Not even basic over-the-counter pain relievers. “God can work miracles. We have to trust that God will heal us, not doctors. Besides, we don’t believe in science. Especially since they don’t let God be taught in schools anymore. Science and the big bang theory goes against God. But we will just trust that God will heal us," Mom would continue on. “It’s true! Like that time when you, Kelly, were only two years old. You were running at church when you fell and I saw your forearm bend and heard it snap. You broke your arm! But right away, I closed my eyes and prayed, ‘Oh Lord Jesus, please heal her. In Jesus' name.’ You started to cry, but stopped when I prayed. And when I got to you your arm was healed! You stood up and started running again! See, that proves that miracles are real.” Her eyes would be full with hope that this story would convince me to follow God. I would later learn that Mom shared an extremely similar experience with Sarah, except it was her “leg” that had broken. It is difficult to know whether she mixed memories up or created something in her mind that she wanted to be true: a real life miracle. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A few exceptions for medicine were made, mostly by Dad--like when I got the stomach flu so badly he handed me a red like liquid out of the refrigerator. When I worried that swallowing it would cause me to vomit, he reassured me. “It won’t. It is meant to soothe your stomach.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Hesitantly, I swallowed it, fearing the consequences of not listening to Dad more than throwing up. He was right. Whatever it was, maybe Emetrol, it helped.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Or the time when we learned the extent of Sarah’s allergy to poison ivy. It was so severe that her entire body swelled and she couldn’t open her eyes. Mom was hesitant when Dad took her to the hospital for a shot of steroids. But the quick healing time after her shot was incredible and the rash was nearly gone within hours. The only time that I ever remember Mom taking someone to hospital was during Abe’s teenage years when he broke his bones biking and snowboarding. But overall, I can only recall a handful of incidences any of the nine of us ever saw a medical professional.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On this day, Avalon healed naturally, resting her body with a cool washcloth covering her head. This felt normal. It was how we all recovered from high fevers.
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Somehow, despite being low household income, Mom bought us season passes to a nearby ski resort each year. Maybe it was the money she used from our paper routes. I can’t remember. But, we learned to ski young. During our lessons, Mom told stories of her younger years when she and Dad would ski on the Colorado Mountains. However, dad did not join our ski trips and rarely did anything outside of his usual routine. I liked it better this way. Things felt safer when he wasn’t around. It wasn’t just me, it seemed everyone felt it. Laughter filled the air and things felt lighter.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brothers quickly switched to snowboarding because it was, as they would say, cooler than skiing. I was desperate to fit in with them and, at the age of eight, quickly switched to snowboarding myself. Although they didn’t notice me getting cooler with my snowboard like I had hoped, I remained proud of myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One time I was boarding down a slope at nighttime--after the snow-pack had hardened into a crust of ice. I was picking up more speed than intended and when I turned my board to slow down, the edge caught a sheet of ice and my bottom smashed onto the solid surface. Lying on the ground, I was unable to move for many minutes. I focused on my deep breaths and the quiet air, my mind searching for peace to override the pain. When nothing changed, I pushed through the excruciating pain in my lower back to sit myself up. I waited more minutes and when the pain refused to lessen, forced myself to stand anyway. Unable to stand straight, I walked slouching forward while carrying my snowboard back to the lodge.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I finally made it, I discovered that I couldn’t sit; it was too painful. Sliding a row of chairs next to each other, I curled onto my side, still unable to straighten my back.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, I hurt myself. I can’t move because it hurts too much," I shrieked the moment I saw her returning to the lodge. I wanted to scream. The pain was sharp and achy. “I think I need to go to the hospital. Or I need medicine. Please Mom, anything to stop it from hurting!” My tears were uncontrollable now.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She poked at me to find the location of the injury. “It looks like it's your tailbone. We’ll go home soon and then you can rest it.” She appeared concerned about my restrained movements, but not enough to get me medical attention.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The healing process was slow, taking months. I feared my back may never heal and I would be crooked forever. I moved gingerly, and when I could finally sit, still slouched to one side, making sure not to put pressure on sore spots.  Mom prayed fiercely. “Even if you do go to the doctor, there is nothing that they can do for that sort of injury anyway," she explained.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Today, I long to reach back in time and give that little girl miracle ibuprofen pills. Magic tablets that could have relieved so much pain--or a visit to the doctor for an x-ray to truly know the extent of the injury. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is an injury that follows me. Sitting at my work desk, an ache returns regularly if I do not allow movement to keep the muscles loose. I will never know if a doctor would have quickened the healing process--or helped the long term impacts of this fall. But I do know that they would have provided some relief for the pain. By the age of ten, I had experienced sprained ankles, extensively swollen knees, and even harder hits to the head. This was my first injury serious enough to understand that faith alone was not enough. Prayer didn’t stand a chance against a parent’s callous disregard.

									<h2><i>Schooled</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;One summer, Dad undertook a side job to construct a long staircase reaching from the top of the bluff to the beach for one of Mom’s rental homes. The stunning beachfront cottage was located on the Lake Michigan bluff a few towns over. It wasn’t nearly as exquisite as the million dollar mansions, but stood enormous compared to the beach cottages. We were ecstatic learning that our family would live at the vacation home while Dad built nearly 100 stairs down to the beach.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Isn’t it so nice! They are letting us stay here three weeks!” Mom’s large cheekbones rise and dimples form with her smile. This countenance that radiates so much expression reminds me of Grandma Williams’ doll-like face. It is a shape similar to my own and the same one I imagine a future child of mine having.  Similar to when she has a spiritual revelation, Mom’s bright blue eyes are glowing; she is truly just as excited as us about getting away from the trailer and a sort of vacation--which, aside from occasionally camping or visiting relatives, we had never done.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Memories of helping Mom clean this house flood me as we walk in to the rental. It is what she calls a “split level” home. The shiny bamboo flooring covers all surfaces aside from the downstairs, making it time consuming to clean. Back windows on each level reach across the backyard bluff giving a flawless view of Lake Michigan. Everyone eagerly scatters throughout the rooms, imagining what the next three weeks living like royalty will be like. Although I still have to share a room with Sarah, it is the biggest bedroom that I have ever slept in. So much space that there are nightstands next to each of our beds. Even better, we will both have our own dressers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At first, the trip was amazing. I loved having my own bed and drawers that fit my clothing. My siblings and I enjoyed having cable television to catch up on all of the shows that our friends watched. Josiah's favorite was the Canadian teen drama series Degrassi, which I fell quickly in love with. During the day we learned to play yard games like croquet and ring toss. As evening fell, us siblings usually began a competitive round of monopoly, occasionally changing the rules to make the challenge greater. Mom even appeared more energetic and happy than I had seen in years. She occasionally joined us in play and even cooked big meals like burgers, soups, and casseroles that we enjoyed together at the large dining room table. Life was great. Except, shortly into the trip, I became extremely ill.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Curled onto the living room couch, I can barely move. My stomach muscles are so tight that I imagine knives piercing through their core. “Mom!” I groan through tears. “Make it stop! Please make it stop. It hurts so much!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After asking some questions she assures me that it is one of two things. “Do you need to go to the bathroom? Sometimes when I get stomach pains like that it is just because I have to poop. But Kelly, I really think you’re probably going to start your period soon. Ya, I think it’s just that.” Her eyes squint, showing genuine concern. It is one of those times where I am not sure if she is trying to convince me or herself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After that, she continued on with her days, giving me no pain relievers or stool softeners. Instead, when I cried and begged enough times, she cuddled me on the couch. She actually spent hours with me. But it was never enough, and I ached each time she needed to get back to chore work. When nighttime came, she allowed me to sleep with her outside on the upstairs deck that was connected to the master bedroom. Crashing waves swooshed through my ears and sang a sleepy lullaby. Beach scents filled the air and a cool breeze evened our body temperatures under the pile of heavy blankets. For a moment, my stomach pains stopped.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Over the next week I go to the bathroom constantly hoping to feel better but know that this doesn’t feel like a constipation issue. Each time I go I check my underwear. Nothing. The more time passes, the more jittery my body becomes. It is getting difficult to sit still.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Back at the trailer, I am used to spending hours per day riding my silver Razor scooter back and forth on the clumpy entryway sidewalk. We have lots of these skateboards with handles. They are the ones that Mom bought us to use on paper routes. Each Saturday, she drops us at key points and we all ride in different directions delivering the “West Haven Tribune” to houses. This is how we get spending money for things like all-terrain vehicles, snowboards, and our trampoline. Thinking back, I wonder if this is how we got season passes to Timber Ridge Ski Resort or summer trips to amusement parks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom even opened individual savings accounts for our money, although sometimes, my money was known to disappear. Usually, Mom said that she didn’t know anything about it despite being the only person with access to my account. Other times, she admitted to taking some money because I “owed” her for some past offense, like getting an attitude or not helping enough around the house. “Well, Kelly, you did owe me for that time awhile back when you got a bad attitude with me.” If I argued back, she escalated “You know what Kelly, you’re so ungrateful! All I do is give, give, give, and do everything for you kids and you do nothing in return. I gave birth to you and the least you could do is say thank you!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I shot back with my new go-to response “I wish I had never been born! I don’t know why you gave birth to me if my existence is such a burden anyway!” This nearly always ended the argument. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On my scooter at home, I would disappear into my imagination creating scenarios for myself. Sometimes I would be surviving in the wilderness. Other times I made myself a superhero with powers to destroy all of my abusers. But mostly, I imagined a day when I would be an adult with a family of my own.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the vacation house, my need to ride my scooter eventually overpowers the stomach pains. Luckily, I brought my scooter. I grab it and begin rolling up and down the driveway, but it’s not the same. The driveway is at a slant and it feels like too many people can see me. Instead, I head for the side of the house and pick up a stick. Pacing back and forth in the grass, I twirl, swing, and toss it into the air, disappearing into my imagination. It is not quite as pleasurable as my scooter time at the trailer, but it is enough to calm the jitters. Within hours, my stomach pains disappear.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As an adult, I now know that my pains were a bodily stress reaction from multiple forms of abuse. But at this time, the stress of changing the environment and routine were too much for my body, causing the trigger of physical symptoms. It was not constipation or menstruation pains, but the beginning of stomach issues that would worsen throughout the years, especially in adulthood. Mom and Dad continued neglecting my physical symptoms yet somehow, my mind found its way toward resiliency through endless hours zooming back and forth on a sidewalk. When I stopped to turn around, the scooter swung, bouncing off a leg each time, leaving bruises all over my shins and calves. No one noticed and yes the bruises hurt, but it didn’t matter because it was my world. The only place where I obtained full control. It was my bubble of safety where nothing from the outside world could truly reach me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Looking back at this time in an idyllic rental home, I realize how unsafe and unsettled I felt most of the time. But, despite the chaos created by her, Mom remained my foundation. And it took many years into adulthood to understand how unsteady this support was. Her mood changed rapidly and unpredictably. Sometimes I believe she genuinely lacked control over her emotions. Other times I seemed she changed as a form of master manipulation. 
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;With only having a high school degree and no training in education, Mom put in a good effort homeschooling us. She bought us second-hand paperback workbooks in math and writing, and during my elementary years, Mom was able to teach us the basics. She successfully taught Josiah and Chase to read and write, then Chase taught me and my other siblings. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I loved to learn, and each page completed brought me satisfaction. I dreamt I was just like my friends who went to public school, even enjoying the very smell of books. Whether fresh paper and ink or sweet and musty, I absorbed the scent of learning something outside of what I knew. I could read all of the words and my spelling was great. But I had little to no reading comprehension. I guessed what books were about based on the covers and what my homeschool friends liked. My favorite books were American Girl and <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> and I understood a few scenes but overall when I finished a book, I wouldn’t be able to tell someone what it was about--even if my life depended on it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the time, numbers made more sense to me than reading. Especially adding, subtracting, and fractions. They were like a puzzle to be solved. However, despite the tears shed and individual lessons from Mom and brothers, I never mastered the art of long division. Sometimes we finished the workbooks, but mostly they were passed onto the next sibling when we didn’t complete them by the end of the school year. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;With my limited education, I taught my little siblings what I could. Helping them became my real life version of playing house. I pretended to be a mom who worked as a teacher. Or just a teacher. Or a stay-at-home mom. Anything that I wanted really. The fact that it earned me love and attention made me appreciate it even more. So much so that before long, I became Mom’s biggest helper. Most days, she assigned us work and tried to get us to complete it. But we were rambunctious kids with no structure and many of those days, we won the battle in avoiding schoolwork when Mom fell asleep on the couch, exhausted from trying to wrangle us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah was a particularly strong-willed child who rarely completed his schoolwork. When he did sit to work, he spent his time staring out the living room window daydreaming. He and I fought ferociously. Josiah found daily amusement in taunting me, usually in small ways that others couldn’t see. Like mouthing mean things to me, pinching me, pulling my hair, or making up stories and laughing when I got into trouble. Mom never believed my defense and it was a rare occasion that she caught him in the act, always making it a “he said, she said” type of situation. And I always lost, except when it came to school.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One day, I sat on the couch working on schoolwork. Josiah finally came to the living room after hours of Mom's pestering. Grabbing his book, he slammed himself down, smushed against me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah, move! You’re sitting on my leg! I can’t write!” I groaned.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He smirked, “What are you gonna do about it.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom interfered when the argument erupted. “Stop it! Just stop it both of you!” Josiah and I were continuing our daily routine. One that Mom mostly didn’t care about. Except when she did. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Screw this. I’m not doing my school.” He laughed before getting up and heading toward his bedroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, you are!” With clenched teeth and tight muscles, Mom rushed to the kitchen.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she snapped was unpredictable, but the events that followed were routine. She grabbed a wooden spatula and chased Josiah around the house. I scurried and just barely avoided the swing of it when he landed on the couch next to me. He did not have the same luck and was trapped. She hit him repeatedly while he burst into laughter. When he didn’t cry, she swung harder, until the wooden spatula broke. Then, his laughter intensified when she returned with a metal one.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she realized she couldn’t spank him hard enough to do what she wanted, she took a different route.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Fine!” she shouted, throwing the spatula to the ground. “You guys think you don’t need me?! You can take care of yourselves! Or better yet, you can stay here and live with your dad! See how you like that! No one here loves or appreciates me anyway! I’m leaving and I’m never coming back!” Her high pitched scream stung my ears.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she left, the trailer fell silent and everyone returned to what they were doing, except schoolwork. Avalon, who was still a toddler, followed me around so quietly that she was nearly invisible. Eventually, I realized she was pretending to be a dog and clung to me for safety. She tried not to be noticed when she crawled on all fours behind me, but I always noticed her. Or maybe she did know. Maybe that’s why she stayed with me. Her gentle presence brought me just as much comfort. When she felt particularly scared, she licked me to get my attention. On this particular day, she snuggled into my side on the couch and began licking my arm.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Gross Avalon! Stop licking me!” I shrieked. She didn’t like my reaction and it was followed by a bite. When I flinched away, my voice rose. “What are you doing?! That doesn’t mean bite me!” When I looked down, her watery blue eyes caught mine. She was fighting tears and let out a gentle puppy whimper. My heart shattered. Her eyes screamed. “I’m scared. Notice me. Love me. Protect me.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m sorry Avalon, it just grosses me out when you lick me. And look, you left a bite mark on me!” Her eyes didn’t shift from mine.  She let out more whimpers, wanting to tell me something but not having words. I pulled her into my arms, knowing no matter how closely she snuggled into me, she couldn’t get close enough to feel fully safe. I hugged her tightly, not daring to let go. There was something powerful about being able to give her the love that I was longing from Mom. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Each time we upset Mom to the point of her running away from home, I opted for cleaning. My siblings weren’t bothered by her absence. Or if they were, coped differently. But I feared she truly wouldn’t return. I poured Avalon some dry cereal and still in puppy mode, she ate directly from the bowl on the floor. Once finished, her head nudged me for a bowl of water. Then, she followed me around while cleaning, sometimes even persuading me to attach her to a dog leash. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I knew that if Mom did come back it would make her happy that the trailer would be clean and my school would be done. If I was good enough then she wouldn’t want to leave again. Or better yet, she'd take me with her. I always blamed myself. And what about Avalon? I couldn’t be her full-time dog parent.

									<h2><i>The Snake Game</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the years went on, I began to question Mom about being gone so much. “I was cleaning a rental house. It took longer than expected," she would explain nonchalantly. When I was around seven years old, she began a cleaning rental business of her own. In addition to cleaning, owners hired her to find renters for their mansions and cottages. This business picked up fast and did require a lot of her time. But her response still didn’t make sense. The massive homes took six or seven hours to clean, but not all night. And sometimes, she left the trailer before sunrise, but renters never checked out before 10am. She was also spending multiple hours a day talking on her cellphone. When she wasn’t on it, the bulky Nextel phone rang repeatedly. She was hiding something and by age eleven, my newly adolescent brain was determined to find out what.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One hot and sunny day, Mom agreed to bring me to “Save A Lot,” a grocery store in town. She used to bring me to the store nearly every time she went. It allowed both of our needs to be met because while I soaked up the opportunity to spend time with her, she enjoyed the help. But over the last couple of years, she brings me less and less. The rare occasion that she does, she is talking on the phone the entire time. Her voice becomes gushy and I can’t get her attention. “I miss you too. Where are you working today?” My cheeks hurt just looking at the smile plastered on her face.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom ignores me for the entire drive and instead pays full attention to the stranger on the other end of her phone call. Singing along to Mom’s favorite Christian musician, Ray Boltz, it’s my turn to ignore her when she shushes me. She pulls into the parking lot, but I’m no longer in the mood for grocery shopping--and I’ve become more suspicious than ever. I hatch a quick plan. “You go in, I’m tired and want to wait here.” I lean my seat back and prop my feet onto the dash, squeezing my fabric skirt between my legs so it doesn't fall up. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you sure? I have a lot of groceries to get. But I’ll try to be quick!” Using a big blue clip, she pins her long dark hair back.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, I’m sure. But Mom, can I have your phone so I can play the snake game while I wait?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I play the game until she is out of sight, then I click out of it. Mom usually tells me that she is talking to the owners of her rental homes, but it is clear to me that’s a lie. Checking her recent calls, disappointment floods me when I realize that the number is not programmed into her phone. It is however, the same number repeatedly showing down the list. I am shocked to see that she and this mystery person are calling each other twenty to thirty times a day. I’ve got her. I knew she was lying. All of the owners of her rental homes are programmed into her phone. This is someone else. Half satisfied with my results, I return to my game and wait.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom returns to her drivers seat after unloading the groceries and begins adjusting her own lengthy skirt. “Hey Mom, who is the person that you’re always talking to on the phone?” I ask immediately.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, that’s just the owner of Beach Haven.” She starts the van, unfazed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, it’s not. I checked your recent calls and it's just this random number. But the owners of beach haven are programmed into your phone. See, you haven’t talked to them since the other day.” I scroll through the numbers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, they are just calling from a different number,” she speaks calmly and confidently, her voice innocent, as if believing her own lie.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“But why would they need to talk to you so much? You don’t talk to any of the other homeowners that much.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know Kelly, I just do.” Her voice is sharp with building irritation. “You’re so spoiled. Instead of going through my stuff you could have helped me unload the groceries. But no. Instead you sit out here playing games on my phone thinking that the entire world revolves around you. You’re really selfish, you know that Kelly?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My face heats with shame and I sink back into my seat. “Whatever. I still don’t believe you.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know what? I’m not getting you a treat just for getting an attitude with me!” Her voice raises. A treat was usually my gift for picking up extra tasks to help her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was developing a strong will and snapped back repeatedly, until we were in a full screaming match. Eventually, when I knew the argument was hopeless, I backed down. And I always got the last word, which would be something like “I hate you!”, “I wish I was dead!” or “Why did you even give birth to me if you didn’t want me?!” I was beginning to find words for emotions that I had felt for years. Yet she never responded when I spoke them to her. Instead, silence filled the air and no comfort was provided. Even in that, I was invisible.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I knew that Mom and George had a strange relationship. Mom continued taking me on the late-night visits--except we no longer met at George and Anna’s house. Instead, she would take me to empty or half built houses that he was painting. Sometimes I was allowed in but mostly, my little siblings and I were asked to wait in the van for hours into the night. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Whenever we passed his painter’s van around town, Mom stared, unable to peel her eyes away. When I noticed, I attempted to stop her by striking up a conversation. Or, when it happened enough times, I said nothing and simply got an attitude the next time she talked to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;So many emotions spiraled out of control within me, but I hadn’t the faintest clue what to do with them. I didn’t know if I should be more angry that Mom was fixated on another man more than me or that she was lying about it. Or maybe I was mad that she had a way of directing conversations back toward something being wrong with me. She always chastised my smallest sins, but who would hold her accountable for her own wicked ways? Until that point, my entire childhood was geared toward making her happy. Maybe then she would have time for me. If anyone had earned the right for her attention, it was me. Not George. I was also beginning to understand that each time she abandoned me it wasn’t because she needed to be alone to calm down. Instead, there was someone else more worthy of her time.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Everything was so confusing. In the past, Mom only saw my heavy sadness but suddenly, a rage was boiling beneath the surface.

									<h2><i>Late, Again</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Our minivan speeds down a paved country road, heading from Clinton, a few towns over, to West Haven. An irritated grumble slips from my mouth, “Ugh, Mom, seriously? Can’t you go any faster?!” 
										<br>									
										&emsp;&emsp;I am slowly perfecting my adolescent attitude. Plus, my body is fidgety with anticipation. Moments before, we were petting animals and hopping on fair rides at an exotic animal sanctuary. Except this trip wasn’t as fun as past ones. You see, at age ten, I had finally talked Mom into signing me up for the soccer team with my friends. But I recently learned that none of them were on the same team as me. Even worse, I pestered Mom to leave for the past hour in an effort not to be late. That was after checking the time on her phone repeatedly to stay on track. But I couldn’t control her nor the fact that I was going to be at least twenty minutes late.
										<br>									
										&emsp;&emsp;“Never mind Mom, let’s just go home. Going isn’t even worth it anymore.” My body is beginning to shake as we near the parking lot. I was already nervous about my first practice and couldn’t stand the humiliation of being late on top of it.
										<br>									
										&emsp;&emsp;After parking, Mom turns around in her seat, eyebrows furrowed with irritation. “You know what Kelly, you are going to go. I brought you all the way here listening to your attitude and I didn’t have to do that. Okay? You could at least say thank you. So just get out! Just out of here and go! Okay Kelly? Just go! I’m sick of it! I’m just so sick of it!” Her tone builds from critical to screaming. I leap from the van before she can say another word.
										<br>									
										&emsp;&emsp;A group circles in the far end of the field. Seeing how they are the only people here, this must be who I’m looking for. My entire life people have told me that I am shy when first getting to know someone. After that, I can’t stop talking. My friends and their parents often ask me if I even breathe between sentences because I talk so fast. I just have so many thoughts to share with anyone willing to listen. But this is not one of those days. This is a day where I wish for nothing more than to disappear.
										<br>									
										&emsp;&emsp;As I slowly approach, the entire team shifts their eyes in my direction. It’s a small town yet not a face recognizes me. The coach, Mr. Frost, has thinning white hair and a mustache and beard which make him look like he could be Santa Claus in a few years. He looks kindly enough, but by the stares of the girls and the way he looks me up and down, I know that I am different. I just haven’t had a chance to think about how or why.
										<br>									
										&emsp;&emsp;“Welcome, you’re uhhh…” He pauses, waiting for me to finish. 
										<br>									
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m Kelly. Sorry I’m late. My mom was uhhh… struggling to get here on time.” I say, wanting to show that I would have been on time had things gone my way but not knowing how.
										<br>									
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, yes. Welcome! Were you notified about the equipment required to play soccer?” He points toward my feet.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Looking down, I notice my old ripped tennis shoes. Mom recently began letting me wear homemade baggy cotton “shorts” that hung just past my knees. They were bright colors and had strange floral designs on them. I was used to those being different from my friends' style. But never before had I gotten this weird of looks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, no. I just...Uhhh... my mom told me to wear shorts and tennis shoes.” My face is on fire and I think I might throw up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’ll let you play today but next time you are going to need cleats, shin guards, and soccer socks," he explains.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;What are those? I wonder. My eyes glance at the girls around me who are all wearing similar shoes with spikes on the bottoms, and tall socks that cover something bulky going up the length of their shins. My humiliation grows and I curse Mom in my head. “Why did she let me come without getting me proper equipment? Why didn’t she even tell me that I would need these things?” I want to scream at her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, okay. Uh, Yes sir," I sputter out.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Alright everyone, grab a partner and head to the goal!” Coach Frost instructs.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Before I begin walking one of the girls approaches me. She is shorter than me with a rounder face and her light brown hair is barely long enough to stay in her ponytail. My hair is similar. Mom recently agreed to give me layers when trimming it except she messed up so many times that she had to keep going shorter. My hair falls just above my shoulders. No layers, but it’s the shortest it has been in my life.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Hey! Do you wanna be my partner?!” The girl asks. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uh, sure!” My voice perks up, feeling relieved that someone has chosen me for their partner.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“My name is Carly! I am from Bangle and my older sister plays on one of the other teams.” Talking is so easy for her and somehow, she pulls me right out of my shy bubble. It feels like an instant friendship. I participate in my first formal soccer practice without incident, hoping to fit in with my peers for the rest of the season. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But of course, Mom was just as late picking me up as she was dropping me off. For future practices and games she was sometimes an hour or even more late.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You can go, I am okay to wait by myself," I told Coach Frost every time.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh no, I can’t leave you here. How about you try calling your mom again?” He would hand me his flip phone.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She rarely answered and when she did it was similar to when I was left at the Vincent's house. “Oh, oops! I forgot! I’ll leave right now!” Or “Sorry, my errands took longer than expected. I’ll be there in fifteen minutes!” I never truly knew when she would show.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One day, we waited so long that coach Frost drove me home to the trailer where Mom was inside doing housework, not having left to come and get me yet which was weird, because the soccer field was no more than a five minute drive from where we lived. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, I was just going to leave and come get you!” she explained. “He really brought you home? That was so nice!” I normally talked Mom’s ear off about my day anytime I was in her presence, except during times when I was angry like this. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya Mom, we were waiting. Why didn’t you come?” It was nice of him to drive me home, but I’m sure it was an easier choice than waiting however much longer for my ride. I never had words for whatever response she mustered. Usually, I rolled my eyes and walked away.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Joining the soccer team felt like my first step into the mainstream world. At the age of ten, I had never been surrounded by so many people attending public school all at once. Many of them even attended the baptist church located just down the street. “They go to church. They can’t be that bad, right?” I quickly convinced myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The truth is, I felt like I belonged to this group of girls more than my own family. I was surprised that they looked past my ugly out-of-style clothes and straight toward my personality. Laughing at all of my jokes, they even encouraged my talking. Being with people who enjoyed my presence so much gave me a high that I would chase for years to come. I was learning that in the public school world, I could easily become anyone's best friend. Being worldly might not be as sinful as Mom thought. She was right in that it would change me forever.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Kelsey’s continued friendship also exposed me to more worldly things. When she was five, she moved across town into a white ranch style house with her mom, Rebecca, and her new husband. Rebecca worked a lot and Kelsey spent many days home alone. Most of her friends weren’t allowed at her house due to a parent never being there. Although mom occasionally didn’t like me visiting Kelsey when there was no adult supervision, she was inconsistent even in this. Usually if I begged hard enough, she caved and let me go to her house anyway. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Even when we were only six years old there were many occasions in which we babysat Kelsey’s niece, Scarlett, while her older brother, and his girlfriend were at work. Today, when Kelsey and I talk about this, neither of us can believe that we knew how to change diapers and feed a baby at such young ages. Even more shocking, that we were entrusted to do so all alone. Yet, I had regularly helped care for my younger siblings too. It was a motherly role that we were both taught and expected to do. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I felt much safer there than at home where I was in danger of being psychologically, sexually, and physically abused by others. At Kelsey’s, there were no worries about people fighting or someone touching me. Things were routine and expected, just she and I in control of our whole world. We spent many of these days playing with Barbie dolls and imagining all of the adult scenarios. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Barbies were forbidden by Mom: “Their clothes come off and it shows their naked bodies with boobs and butts. And they only make them with sexy women. They are too provocative.” It felt, even at this young age, like Mom was ashamed of women’s bodies. As if just existing in a women’s body was a sin in itself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At Kelsey’s, I rebelled in all of the best ways. Playing Barbies, painting my nails, experimenting with makeup, and yes, even wearing her bootcut jeans instead of my frayed skirts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was becoming confident in my independence. She taught me how to make packaged ramen noodles, ravioli, and “Spaghettios” in the microwave. We completed the list of chores that her mom left, including the hard ones like cleaning their above ground pool and doing laundry. I do not remember a time in which I worried about my safety at Kelsey’s--which in retrospect is amazing since two children were left to themselves for hours on end. 
										<br></p>
										~
										<p><br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Let’s go to the bathroom light and finish our makeup!” Kelsey’s friend Kiera instructs me. It’s Kelsey’s eleventh birthday and the house is flooded with eight highly excited adolescent girls. It’s a dark August night, late into the slumber party and Avril Lavigne’s recently released song “My Happy Ending” blares from the television. Even Kelsey’s mom, cigarette and beer in hand, joins the rambunctious singing and dancing. Some girls, including me, break to do makeup and nails. I loved that Kelsey included me with her friends. They all attended public school together and most of my friends would be too embarrassed to have me around their mainstream friends. Kelsey and Olive were my two friends who never seemed to care about my family being different. I was fully accepted. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One of Kelsey’s new friends, Delaney, joins Kiera and me in the bathroom. Kiera tells me that the blue eyeshadow will go with my eyes. As I brush it on, I remember Mom talking about one of her friends. “She always wears that blue eyeshadow and I just think it's so ugly. Colored eyeshadow just makes women look promiscuous and… well, kind of like a whore.” Remembering her words, I immediately feel insecure. It’s okay though, because I don’t mind looking promiscuous at this party. It is the most fun I have had in months, or maybe even years. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Kiera’s personality seemed kind and relaxed. It made sense that people enjoyed her company and I certainly was enjoying doing typical girly things. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So Delaney, why did you and your mom end up moving here?” Kiera asks. Being new to town, Delaney was popular and everyone was getting to know her. Her dark brown hair was pulled into a messy bun. I always wished I could make such a cute bun with my own hair, but I could never pull off that sort of effort on my own. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Delaney stiffens and her voice goes soft. “Well, my last school principal molested me in his office so my mom and I moved here to get away from him.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Kiera’s jaw falls into the biggest gape I have ever seen. I am confused by the interaction, but hang my jaw open to pretend that I know exactly why we are shocked.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A short while later, when Delaney steps out, I look to my friend. “Kiera, what does ‘molested’ mean?” I have never heard this term before.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, it means that he touched her. You know, inappropriately. Down there.” She points and whispers as if this conversation is the worst form of gossip. Her curly hair frizzes out from her head and eyes bulge so big that I know she is horrified by Delaney's experience.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, really?!” I am trying to understand the magnitude of what this means. Specific details of the principal's office and him touching her form in my mind. No one has shared these details, yet I can picture her experience as if I were there. Taking a seat on the toilet lid, chills form throughout my body. My stomach aches thinking about a man being capable of such abominable acts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Subconsciously, I was interweaving my own sexual abuse and her experience together. Consciously, I made no connection since Josiah and his sexual abuse never made an appearance in my mind when he wasn’t in my presence. I was able to disconnect and block it all out--another coping mechanism I developed over the years. But in that bathroom I was able to feel Delaney’s experience as if it were my own. Mom wanted me to avoid Barbies and wear dresses to protect my body from men’s sinful thoughts, yet failed to protect me from horrific physical and sexual abuse in her own home. I couldn’t imagine having a mother that moved me out of harm’s way as Delaney’s did.

									<h2><i>Trash</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom rushes through the trailer living room filling a bag with trash and clutter. For the past couple of years, she dreamt of a bigger home for us. Maybe it happened when she noticed the trailer rotting from the inside out.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She was right, the small white trailer that housed too many was deteriorating rapidly. I remember a time that I sat on the raggedy thrift store sofa working on my 6th grade math book when Mom appeared from the hall. Her big jean skirt, always pulled well over her belly, swooshed with air as she moved.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You wouldn’t believe it! I was in the boys room and found little mushrooms growing in the wall!” Her voice was hurried and aghast. “I was talking to Macy from Friday school the other day and asked her if our house smelled. She said that it kind of does have a bad smell. Isn’t that kind of embarrassing?” She paused in thought, uncertain about what to do with her newfound information.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I rushed to the boys’ bedroom, curious to know what Mom was referring too. Crawling across the bottom bunk that was shoved against the back window, I reached the moist area where surrounding walls dripped with sweat. Looking down, I observed mushrooms growing on the soft black substance expanding throughout the surfaces. A familiar musty stench filled the air. Although I had not known the words for what was growing, the mold and mushrooms were familiar. I sat back in curiosity, wondering how Mom was just noticing the soggy wall.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After this discovery, she threw her romance novels aside and instead dove into reading a variety of homebuilding magazines. Occasionally, we even visited homes that were for sale to get an idea of what she wanted. She didn’t want to move away from our West Haven property and instead hoped to demolish the trailer to build a beautiful new two story home in its place.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her ideas were passed onto us kids. I dreamed of living in a nice new clean home with a bedroom of my own. Like Mom, I imagined that this would solve all of our problems. With additional space, everyone’s irritability would dissipate, there would be less clutter, and we could become the “normal” family I desired. The way Mom’s eyes glistened talking about a new house gave me hope that she would uncover the happiness she searched for. If Mom were not so stressed, she might have time to spend with us--even enjoying our company. Things would be safe and we would be like a normal family. I was jittery with excitement.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, Mom and Dad decided it would be more financially feasible to sell the West Haven property and move to an enormous house in Concord, a few towns over. The retro split level home stood on top of a hill surrounded by woods. The yard was small with barely any property compared to what we were used to and I still had to share a bedroom with both Sarah and Avalon. Sharing didn’t matter though because the room was so massive that it fit two bunk beds, three dressers, and still had plenty of playing area. The boys room was just as big and Josiah, being the oldest still living at home, had his own room downstairs.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Every room felt gigantic. The kitchen had an entire wall of wooden cupboards with a pantry beside it. There were four bathrooms, a two-car garage, and a basement. Not to mention the biggest laundry room I had ever seen, which Mom was most excited about. It was a new beginning. One that Mom was sure would fix her marriage and family. For me, it was a step closer to feeling like I could belong to the world. 
									</p>
										~
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Back at the trailer, we have a few more loads to grab. “Everyone, grab a trash bag and start packing!” Mom instructs moving as quickly as possible. Abe, Avalon, and I lazily get to work. Or maybe it was Daniel, not Abe. Avalon and I seem to disagree about the brother who was present that date.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly in, a long tan car that we know to be Anna’s parks at the end of the driveway. “Uh, Mom, someone’s here. It kind of looks like…Ya, it’s Anna’s car.” Abe explains peering out the window and down the driveway.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, it is Anna! And Mom... she does not look happy! She’s like… running!” I say with an uncomfortable laugh. Anna was rushing across the front lawn toward our front door.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, really?” Mom's jaws clenches and her face shows concern as she squints out the window.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Avalon, lock the door!” Abe shouts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, quickly! Lock it!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’ll get the door!” five-year-old Avalon exclaims, already almost there. Before any of us can react Anna barges through the door, shoving Avalon backwards onto the floor.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Avalon!” I exclaim, squeezing past Anna. She doesn’t see me; her eyes have a different destination. When I reach Avalon, I pull her from the floor, wrapping her into a tight hug. “Are you okay?!” Anna is big and the shove was hard.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m okay. Kelly, look!” She points past me toward the living room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh my gosh!” We rush toward that direction together, but I don’t dare let go of her hand.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When we arrive, Abe stands back near the far wall. “Stop! Anna, I said stop! What are you doing?!” He is stern, taking on an adult role.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom and Anna are in a physical fight, shoving and swatting each other while screaming at the tops of their lungs. “You slept with my husband! Who do you think you are?! You’re a slut, Penny! A slut! You will pay for this!” Anna’s high-pitched screams pierce my ears.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know what you’re talking about! You are crazy Anna! And you need to get out of my house!” The fight continues. Eventually Mom reaches for the rotary dial telephone but before she can finish dialing 9-1-1, Anna rips the cord from the wall. Back and forth they shove each other until eventually Mom thrusts so hard that Anna tumbles backwards to the floor, smashing onto a guitar. Everything falls silent. She’s too heavy and can’t get up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom breaks the silence: “Get out of my house! You’re crazy! Get out of here and don’t ever come back!” She continues screaming while Anna attempts to get up. It is a lengthy and painful process to watch, but she eventually regains balance, heads for her car and speeds away.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, Mom… Mom, are you okay?!” I finally muster words and the three of us kids rush to her side.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I’m fine. Thank you for asking. Sorry kids, I can’t believe she came here like that. She’s so crazy! I don't even know what she was talking about!” Mom appears jittery with nerves, struggling to calm down.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Luckily, us kids are pros at this. “I can’t believe she tried to fight you! But look Mom, you won! Guys, did you see how she was so fat that she couldn’t even stand up?!” We take turns making the horrific situation into a joke until everyone, including Mom, is in tears from laughter.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For some reason, my mind struggled to make connections between Mom’s interactions with George and this incident. Maybe it was too much to believe that she was capable of choosing another man over her own kids and husband. Especially considering her strong religious beliefs that were drilled into us. Divorce and adultery were two of the biggest sins in her eyes--ones that she warned us about daily. There’s no way that she herself would commit such an act.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;An even bigger part of me wanted to believe Mom. Knowing that she lied so consistently--and so well--was too painful. Acknowledging that would mean facing the fact that maybe she was never the person I thought her to be. Her abandonment of us kids wasn’t from being too busy or overwhelmed, it was an active choice. My entire life Mom had been our ally but with time I began feeling like a pawn in her game. She was smarter than I had thought and I did not enjoy being used.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This memory was buried deep in my mind until seven years later when I are dinner with Jacob and his then wife, Cecilia. Avalon, twelve years old, was visiting the apartment where I lived with them for the weekend. During the meal we laughed and shared family stories--mostly ones that Jacob knew little about, since he moved from the trailer the moment he turned eighteen. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh my gosh Kelly!” Avalon’s beautiful golden blond hair falls past her shoulders. Her angelic face bright with laughter. “Remember that time at the trailer when Anna came over and her and mom got into a fight?” She’s laughing so hard that she struggles to finish.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh my gosh! Yes I do! I had completely forgotten about that!” I burst into laughter with her, automatically remembering the joke we had turned it into.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Wait, your mom got into a physical altercation?” Cecilia asks, sounding confused. Avalon and I pause, looking to the other end of the table. Cecilia’s face is appalled and Jacob sits beside her, frozen stiff. “That’s awful you guys. I can’t believe that your mom got into a fight. And that it was in front of you.” Her tone and face show that in addition to shock, she is clearly judging Mom. Or is she judging us? It is difficult to know. Suddenly, I feel embarrassed for laughing. This is one of the many moments where an experience that felt completely normal to me was met with horror from anyone outside the family. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, ya I guess she did. I had completely forgotten about it. Avalon, I can’t believe you remembered that. You were so young!” I attempt to bring the conversation back to a lighthearted state.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, that’s really awful that you experienced that," Cecilia continues. With discomfort hanging in the air, Jacob quickly changes the subject. I give Avalon a half-smile and rub on the shoulder, assuring her that she did nothing wrong by bringing up the story. Still protective over her, I want to make sure that she feels no embarrassment. Jacob and Cecilia might be uncomfortable, but I understand her memory. It deserves to be discussed. She is not alone in that.

									<h2><i>Public Schooling</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Some time after the move, when I was 13 years old, mom finally caved in letting me attend public school. “Okay, just the older kids. You, Chase, and Abe can go to public school. The others are still too young," she decided. At the time, I believed that I had worn her down and guilt-tripped her enough to allow me into public school. In retrospect, she probably sent us in preparation for the divorce. Maybe I could never outsmart the expert manipulator--and besides,I should have known that if she agreed to let me go to public school, it wouldn’t have been without a price to pay. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We lived outside the West Haven City limits, making the school bus unavailable. Chase primarily transported me, but on days when he worked after school, Mom often failed to pick me up on time. As I sat near the administrative office eagerly waiting for her van to arrive, I would glance over to the school secretaries and could see the concern in their eyes. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Hey, give your mom another call because we need to close the office now.” I could only imagine what they were thinking as saying this: <i>What do we do with her if her mom doesn’t come?</i> or <i>How long do I have to wait for this kid’s mom so that I can go home?</i> As usual, I was mortified, with no control over the situation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Luckily, shortly after I began school, Mom also agreed to let me get my first cell phone. It was for emergencies, such as this. When she failed to show, I called Grandma Williams to pick me up. “Hey, Mom is taking forever to pick me up from school. Can you come get me and I wait at your house?”  It amazed me how she always arrived within a few minutes, no questions asked.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Starting school for the first time in 8th grade was an entirely new world. Similar to my first experience playing soccer, people looked at me as if I were something foreign for having a style that didn’t match society and I was fully aware of my humiliating differences. Shame swallowed me with constant awareness of my long skirts and ugly blouses. Finally, with enough pestering, Mom allowed me to wear extremely loose pants if they did not show any curves on my body. The style didn’t match my friends. Not even close. It was however, progress.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As insecure as I felt, people loved the new girl. Their competition over me was completely overwhelming. Years before, I watched a movie called <i>Mean Girls</i> about a homeschooled teen who goes to public school for the first time. She finds herself being pulled in different directions while navigating which peer group she fits into--each one having different expectations, styles, and behaviors. She just wanted to make friends, but her attempts at trying to belong to many different groups failed as she found herself in the midst of serious drama and broken friendships.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My experience couldn’t have been more similar. The first friends to welcome me were kind and smart. Their style didn’t necessarily match mine, but it was different from everyone else’s. We were the misfits. The first few weeks I gladly bounced between two misfit groups, spending the weekends at the movie theater and sleepovers. We ended the nights learning dances like “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” in hopes it would make us cool enough for a popular group.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Life with these friends went well until one day, Demi and I hit it off in English class. “Hey, you should sit with me at lunch! I’ll come find you at your locker!” she exclaimed. She had naturally bleach blonde hair and was both short and thin--so small I wondered if she was sick at times. Yet, somehow, she could eat an entire pizza to herself and not gain a pound. As we got to know each other, she verbalized feeling insecure about how tiny she was and ate more in efforts to gain weight. “My doctor told me that I’m healthy and will grow soon”she often stated as self reassurance. Her body weight experience was quite the opposite of me. No matter how little I ate, my developing womanly body always seemed to put me in higher pants sizes than those around me. It was getting harder to hide my curves. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Without anyone saying anything, I already worried about what eating lunch with the popular girls would mean for my other friends. They spent their years dreaming of belonging to this group and right away, I somehow landed an invite. I felt guilty abandoning the friends who were the first to accept me, but not enough to pass up an opportunity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Demi provided introductions to her friends at the table, but kept me close, as if claiming me as her own. “Now that you’re sitting with us, you can’t sit with them anymore.” Her head nudged toward my other friends. “They are the emo and nerd groups and we don’t hangout with them, okay?” Her tone wasn’t mean, just matter-of-fact, as if this was simply the way things were.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I glanced back at my other friends and convinced myself that switching my lunch group didn’t mean that I was abandoning anyone. “Okay, deal!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I felt confused by the groups and wanted to be friends with everyone. Why did sitting with one person mean that I couldn’t talk to another? This didn’t happen with homeschool friends. Some were closer than others but ultimately, we were all friends. I would later learn that these “cliques” mostly came down to past disagreements which eventually divided people. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eating lunch with Demi did cost me friends, but I also gained new ones, and most importantly, I had a new best friend. For the next two years, Demi taught me all of the ins and outs of public school. Once I caught up with wearing makeup, learning about boys, and squeezing into her skin-tight jeans, we learned the next steps of fitting in together. Her parents were divorced and during weeks when she was with her dad, I went for sleepovers. He even let me stay on weeknights. I spent so many nights there that by the end of the year, I was signed up to ride her school bus. Mom didn’t mind me being gone so much because it was less driving for everyone. In fact, she encouraged it. She also didn’t have to think about taking care of me and my physical, educational or emotional needs. She was becoming unofficially relieved of her parenting duties. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t miss Mom much anymore because my friends were becoming my family. My place of love, acceptance, and belonging. She was being replaced. With that, I began experimenting with alcohol. Many nights when Demi’s dad went to the bar, we grabbed his whiskey from on top of the cupboard and mixed it with orange juice. “This is how my dad does it!” She explained. As the year went on we even began drinking before school. My parents didn’t care what I was up to, so why should I care?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In this new world, people loved me and thought I was hilarious, which helped me feel connected to others more than ever before. Sure, the middle school drama occasionally left me in such tears that sometimes I debated returning home full time. But at the end of the day, this new life was euphoric and I was addicted to it, always striving for the next adventure. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At first, I felt confused by the attention boys in public school gave me. They stared at my behind, telling me that I had that “black girl booty” which was “hot for a white girl.” If I wasn’t paying close enough attention, they even grabbed it as I walked by. Humiliated, I kept walking as if nothing happened. All of my friends assured me it was a compliment. “Oh my gosh, did you see how the football players were just staring at your butt?!” Their eyes would glow, as if I were something mythical.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t want the attention from boys and felt disgusted with the ways they looked at me, but fitting in with my friends was important and this clearly made me more likable to them.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One day, I sat in English class talking to my friends Shayne and Camila. When Camila walked to turn her assignment in, Shayne looked at me and grumbled, “You need to stop being a cock-blocker.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What’s a cock-blocker?” Never having heard the word “cock”, I was truly puzzled. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Don’t worry about it. Just stop cock-blocking, okay?” I couldn’t tell if he was annoyed or amused.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was mortified when Demi later explained the term to me. “That means he has a crush on Camila and you are getting in the way. He probably thinks that because you are always flirting with him.” Demi was so confident and it felt like she knew everything. She had front row seats to drama and all of the new trends.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Flirting? What? I didn’t mean to!” I was shocked.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I have been meaning to ask you, do you have a crush on Shayne?!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A crush? I didn’t know how to answer that. I talked to him just like I spoke to any other boy. Did that mean I had been flirting with everyone? I suddenly felt small, embarrassed, and vulnerable. It was the same feeling from when Abe teased me about having a crush on Charlie. In my efforts for friendship and positive attention was I instead leading guys on? Again, I felt as if something about my very presence was misleading males into sinful sexual desires. There was no escaping it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Eventually, Camila rejected him, and Shayne turned his attention to me. “Oh my gosh Kelly, Shayne likes you! You have to go out with him and have your first kiss!” I pretended to join Demi’s excitement while internally fighting the urge to vomit.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We planned a trip to the movie theater but jitters and knots in my stomach stopped me from focusing on the screen. Occasionally, Demi glanced at me with an expression that meant: <i>He’s going to kiss you! I just know it!</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was relieved when he pulled my face to his. Finally, the building anxiety of receiving my first kiss could end. Except, something about his tongue in my mouth felt familiar. “What was that?” I wondered. Suddenly the room was suffocating me. I stood abruptly and shuffled past people in the dark theater, needing an escape. Demi followed me to the bathroom, thrilled that I braved my first kiss. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“He did it! He kissed you! What was it like?!” Her eyes glistened, as if imagining what her own first kiss might be like. She was so confident in me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“He did! I can’t believe it! It was great!” I didn’t know what else to say. I couldn’t admit how dirty I felt or understand where that feeling came from. Many years later, I would uncover memories of Josiah kissing me. That was the familiar connection. That was the disgust. During the abuse he rarely kissed me making it easy to forget. As with other painful memories, I had become skilled at repressing the memories of the sexual abuse any moment Josiah wasn’t in my presence--which is common in victims of trauma. While as a child I had used certain coping mechanisms of repetitive behavior, creating new happy endings, and praying deeply, I now as an adolescent experienced a dissociative state where I had submerged and denied the abuse and neglect until directly faced with them again; when it wasn’t happening it was as if it didn’t exist. The memories would slowly return over time, but it would be twelve years before they fully surfaced.

									<h2><i>Adulterer</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Life progressed as usual at the Concord house. Mom spent more time cleaning rental houses than at home. Dad continued drowning himself in work and alcohol at his new favorite place, The American Legion. The younger children rarely completed home school work and although I worked hard on completing class assignments, my grades struggled. Nobody was supervising us, and for the first time ever we had cable TV. For some reason, Mom stopped caring about certain things, such as us watching Disney. When I wasn’t off with friends, my siblings and I plunged into watching hours of <i>Hannah Montana</i>, <i>That’s So Raven</i>, <i>The Sweet Life of Zack and Cody</i>, and more. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Although it happened much less often, Josiah continued sexually abusing me in his new bedroom downstairs which was small, cold, dark, and smelled like a teenage boy doused in axe spray cologne. Somehow, I felt myself standing stronger against him. In general, I had developed an expertise at not noticing the male presence. When Josiah forced himself into my eyesight, I rushed out of the room or covered my eyes, pretending he didn’t exist. He usually pestered until I no longer knew how to get him away, but I could definitely hold him off for longer periods of time. I was thrilled at the age of twelve, in the summer of 2006, when he turned eighteen and joined the army.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Either before or after basic training, Josiah got his girlfriend at the time pregnant. He had many girlfriends over the years and it was not unlike him to give me detailed descriptions of his sexual encounters with them while he was abusing me. Nevertheless, each time he informed me of a new girlfriend I hoped: <i>Maybe this one will give him what he needs and he won’t touch me anymore.</i> I wanted to believe this. When Josiah and Lesley announced their pregnancy, I was certain that this was the case: <i>He doesn’t need me for sexual pleasure now! He has his own family!</i> I could barely contain my internal excitement and was devastated when, just a few days later, he called me into his bedroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	I’m sitting on his twin sized bed, eyes focused on a red drum set across the room. When Josiah is gone, I sneak in here and pound them to get my anger out. I understand why he likes them. The noise rumbles loud, drowning out any thoughts in my head. If only he weren’t here so I could do that right now.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He begins caressing my body. “No Josiah, stop. I don’t want to," I whine, desperate to convince him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Common Kelly, I know you want to," he whispers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I don’t. Josiah, you have a girlfriend.” For some reason, this felt like a betrayal to her rather than a form of abuse. I didn’t understand why he would want sexual pleasure from someone else when he had a serious girlfriend. Especially one who would be having his baby soon.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“That’s okay Kelly, it doesn’t change anything.” When he continues caressing I shoot for the door.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Wait Kelly, no! Just wait.” He stands between me and the door.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I’m angry. For this brief moment I don’t care if anyone finds out what he is doing to me. “Josiah, I said stop! If you need sex so badly why don’t you go have sex with your girlfriend!” I scream so loud that he instantly fears someone hearing. Before I can finish, he backs away and lets me through. I wish that I could say that he never touched me again. As much as I wished to be stronger, it was easier to give him what he wanted than to navigate a plan for escaping him I could get it over with quickly rather than prolong they inevitable. Because my mind would neatly store his abuse in a box, I rarely thought of it afterward. Of course the trauma would eventually burst open like Pandora’s box, but for now, I did what I could to cope. 
									</p>
										~
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During the fall of 2007, family life took a drastic turn. I cannot remember what prompted this, but one day, my neighbor friend, Maddy, asked me to talk. She was two years older than me, and I loved having a friend so close. She attended Concord Public Schools and raved about her experiences with competitive cheer. I dreamed of having her style, particularly desiring to wear tight jeans so that I could look like the other girls my age.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was no longer keeping such sinful desires to myself. After convincing Mom to let us attend public school, I now begged her to let me wear tight pants like my friends. She continued refusing, but it would only be a matter of time before I would wear her down. It was becoming clear that one of the reasons for Mom’s inconsistency stemmed from how easily controlled she was. She changed her mind based on what the person in front of her at that specific moment was telling her. It was as if the discomfort of letting someone else down by having her own opinion was too difficult. She couldn’t ever make a decision for herself and was even worse at taking accountability. If I pestered and guilt-tripped her enough, I could get nearly anything I wanted. My brothers didn’t like that I used Mom, but knowing that I could never have the mother’s love I desired, these little acts provided a sense of control. I couldn’t make her love me the way I needed, but I could still maneuver her for my own gain. As a young girl, I watched closely, learning to use her own manipulative tactics against her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Maddy’s home also rests on a hilltop in the middle of the woods. Sitting on her front porch stairs, I closely observe her style. She regularly highlights her dark brown hair, something forbidden by my mother. She is thinner and taller than me, making me wonder if this is what a real life supermodel might look like. Mom thought it was provocative, but I believed the worldly fashion was so beautiful that I wanted to become it. Maybe Mom was right, Satan’s wicked ways were tainting my soul.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So I wanted to let you know something that Josiah told me.” Maddy appears calm, but serious. “He said that your mom has been cheating on your dad,” she explains.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“That’s not true," I sputter, barely allowing her to finish.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Maddy laughs uncomfortably, as if I must be joking. “What? Kelly, you know it’s true. Your mom is gone all of the time and every time she is home you know that she is talking on the phone with George. I mean common, she will literally be gone all night long.” Maddy has spent a significant amount of time with our family over the past two years.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re wrong Maddy, that’s because she is cleaning rental houses. My mom would never cheat on my dad. She thinks it’s a sin.” I hear the defensiveness in my voice but struggle to stop it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, if that’s what you want to believe. But Josiah told me that your mom literally told him that she is having an affair. She even asked him if he would be okay if she divorced your dad and married George.” She is trying desperately to help me see what is right in front of me but I refuse. Mom’s lies over the years have worn me to a point where I now believe them.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? That’s not true. I don’t believe it.” Looking toward our driveway, my eyes settle on Mom leaving in her minivan. <i>Could Maddy be right?</i> I wonder. <i>I mean, Mom is never home and will be gone all night. And she never lets me go with her like I did as a kid. Even so, I have to stick to what I just told Maddy because going back on my word now will just be embarrassing</i>, I convince myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Just days later I am forced to see what my brain has been trying to bury. Mom and Dad are running throughout the house in a raging argument. “You lied to me! You said it was over and that we would give this marriage another try but I can’t believe a thing you say. I bought this house for us because you said it would make you happy and here you are still running around with other men. You’re crazy! Always back and forth and I never know what I’m going to get!” Dads not just yelling, he is in an uncontrollable rage.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“That’s not true, Kurt! You have no idea what you’re talking about! I didn’t lie! I didn’t do anything wrong! Maybe if you weren’t so mean and gone all of the time I would be happy!” Mom’s high-pitched scream makes my ears ring.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I would later learn from Dad that he walked in on Mom and George having sex at a rental home. Yet, despite his own eyes, she denied it. I am normally hesitant to believe Dad when it comes to his and Mom’s arguments, but I have also since learned from Sarah that she also walked in on Mom and George having sex at a rental house even prior to this fight. Right after, when Sarah asked Mom about it, her response was, “What? I don’t know what you’re talking about. That didn’t happen”. It’s as if she lies so naturally that even she believes them before they leave her lips. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad disappears into the basement and a short while later, Mom follows him. Shouting continues. “You don’t know what you’re talking about! Put that down!” Mom screams. Something serious is happening down there. Eventually, she chases Dad up the stairs, smacking him along the way.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What happened down there?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don't know. Let’s go check!” Abe, Sarah, and Chase are whispering to each other as they scamper down the stairs.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I remain stiff on the couch, where I have been for what feels like the past thirty minutes. Terrified, my eyes are stuck on the doorway to the basement. I can’t move even if I tried. Instead, I have been the silent observer of this fight.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Did you see that? That was crazy!” The siblings are in shock when they return from the basement.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;With Mom and Dad back upstairs, I regain control over my body and rush toward the basement but Abe steps in front of me. “Kelly, stop. You do not want to go down there.” He is no longer a young boy and has the voice of a man. I have never heard him sound more serious or protective.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Why not? What’s down there?” I feel an uncontrollable need to know.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It’s nothing. Just promise me you won’t go down there. Okay?” He won’t take his eyes from mine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, whatever. I won’t go down there.” I start to walk away.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Good.” He rushes back upstairs to get eyes back on the fight, ready to take action if Mom needs protecting.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The moment he is gone, I race to the basement. When I arrive, time freezes. Huge blood-red letters are scripted in spray paint covering the concrete walls. “BURN IN HELL, ADULTERER, WHORE, SLUT'' are the ones I remember.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My limbs tremble and the shouts become background noise. It’s just me and the hushed sound of my shaky breathing. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>Kelly, you need to get out of here. Abe was right, you should not have come down here. Gosh Kelly, you’re so stupid, I admonish myself. But I can’t make my body move. It feels like I am in the climax of a horror movie and someone will die at any moment.</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I hear footsteps coming toward the basement, I race up the stairs, stumbling straight into Abe. “I told you not to go down there!” He raises his voice in frustration.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I know. I know you did. I won’t go down there again. I’m sorry.” My voice is shaking. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad’s shouts immediately take over. “We are done. Do you hear me? Done. I’ll file the divorce paperwork and move out just as soon as I find a place," his voice roars while grabbing some essential belongings. As he exits the house, Mom screams, chasing him all the way to his truck.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The silence that follows is deafening. Chase had been clinging tightly to the phone, prepared to call 9-1-1. With Dad gone, he can release it. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Everyone rushes to comfort Mom. She cries while we hug her, then stands to leave, most likely going to see George. Once she’s gone, we kids will disperse and dive into our individual coping regimes. Chase and Abe will each take a computer for video games. Daniel and Avalon will watch them play. Sarah will grab food and numb herself in front of the television. I will clean and organize the house while disappearing into my own thoughts, desperate for Mom’s return, but no longer daring to voice it. It wouldn’t make a difference.

									<h2><i>Our Special Show</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Just days after my parents’ divorce finalized I sat with Mom in the parked minivan at the Concord house. She cried hysterically, which was not an abnormal situation, as I had been comforting her in the van my entire life. However, I felt more hopeful this time. With Dad removed, Mom could truly be happy. Getting a bigger house didn’t work in cheering her up, but we both knew that it was actually Dad’s anger, criticism, and abuse that fueled her unhappiness anyway. At least that’s what I had thought.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Taking a breath through tears, she speaks. “Kelly, I just don’t want to do this anymore. I’m so tired. Nobody really loves me, and I just can’t do this anymore. I just want to die.” The sobs continue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In a gentle voice, I remind her, “I love you Mom. Isn’t that enough for you to want to live?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re right, you do love me. You really do," she whispers it repeatedly, as if trying to convince herself, then returns to uncontrollable tears.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;If reminding Mom that I loved her did not help, maybe finding a way to make her laugh could save her from the dark place. I mustered different forms of jokes, probably something funny about my school day or a fun memory from the past. It was all to no avail.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Suddenly, Mom takes a breath, and states, “you know what would make me happy?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?” I respond curiously, dying to know, suddenly realizing how irritated I feel going on year fourteen of my failed attempts to make her happy.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A sigh of relief escapes her. “George. George makes me happy. He really loves me. You know? He really does. And he makes me happy.” I can’t see her in the dark, but as is common during such times, her voice is slow, depressed, and lacking hope. She pauses and every muscle in my body tightens. I had been stupidly excited, thinking that we kids could finally have Mom’s full attention. If even just for a little while. She always said that the reason she didn’t want to be home was because of Dad. Dad was gone, but it was becoming clear that George was still more important than us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So, What would you think if I married him?” Her voice perks up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I swallow my anger, trying to remain calm. “I don’t want you to marry George. He is weird and he makes me uncomfortable. He smells, and I just don’t like him. I just want it to be you and us kids for a while, Mom. Can’t we do that?” I couldn’t explain why George made me uncomfortable. It was something about the way that he looked at me which reminded me of Josiah. <i>Was it a look of lust?</i> I wondered. And no matter the day or time he always smelled of the worst body odor. I didn’t dare speak it, but feelings of jealousy built with how she adored him more than me, despite my best efforts of earning her love and attention. According to Mom, jealousy was a distasteful sin. Even so, no matter my attempts to douse it, the feeling was consuming me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Mom immediately returned to heavy tears. Evidently, I answered incorrectly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“I know that divorce is wrong. Maybe God is punishing me with these sinful desires because I’m getting a divorce and not staying with your dad. I don’t know Kelly. Maybe I should have stayed with him.” I am annoyed now, desperate for her mood to pass so that we can go back inside and return to life. “I just don’t know. No matter what I do or how much I give, no one really loves me. You know? I can’t do it anymore. I just want to die and go to heaven.” Her tears continue to worsen. She’s spiraling. “But I just know that George…” Another sigh, “He really loves me. He can make me happy. He really can.” she states matter of factly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She can’t see my eye roll, as I work to hide my annoyance. It would only make the situation worse. “I mean… if George will make you happy then… sure. Marry him. I do not want to be the one stopping you from being happy.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Immediately, her tears stop. “Really Kelly? Do you mean that?! He really does love me and makes me happy. You really don’t care? You would do that for me? You love me so much that you would let me marry him?” She turns to me and I hear the awe in her voice, as if I am some sort of saint. Someone she aspires to be. It makes me sick with irritation. I feel weak. No one else would allow someone to take advantage of them like this. A strong person would show their anger. A strong person wouldn’t say that they are ok with something just to make someone else feel better. Even so, I love her too much to be the reason she is unhappy. I convince myself that maybe being strong means making such sacrifices for love. Maybe then, she could eventually do the same for me in a time of need.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I swallow. “Ya, Mom. You should do it.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Oh Kelly, thank you so much. It really means a lot. You’re my special girl, did you know that?” The tears are gone and glee fills her eyes.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>I’m her special girl</i>, I think to myself. Sitting with the words brings joy, but not to the same depth it had as a little girl.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom excitedly interrupts my thoughts, as if she hadn’t been suicidal just moments before. “We were thinking of getting married this Friday!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?” My voice is short, but she ignores it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Let’s have some quality time. How about we go inside and watch another episode of Grey’s Anatomy? I just had another Netflix disk arrive in the mail.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Again, I was a puppet and she, the puppet-master. Dammit. But what was the alternative? Turning a blind eye and letting her kill herself? I couldn’t bear the responsibility of that. As with every other abuser in my life, I’m stuck in a lose-lose situation. Attempting to bury the irritation, I walk inside, forcing excitement about watching our special show.

									<h2><i>Burning</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Near the end of my eighth grade year, I arrived home from school with my new step-dad to the sight of smoke flowing from the lower level of the Concord house. George searched for the cause while I shot upstairs to warn the family. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Guys, the house is on fire! There’s smoke everywhere!” I shout.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What, no! Really?!” Smoke hadn’t reached upstairs yet and at first, they struggled to believe me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When they saw it was real, we gathered our pets, rushed to the van and called 9-1-1. While waiting, Mom repeatedly went back into the house to collect  more belongings--no matter how much we begged her not to. Even so, my siblings and I didn’t show fear. Not even in the moment. We worried about Mom but ultimately, our jitters twisted the trauma into being another “adventure,” finding things to joke about, like how everyone was upstairs having fun while the downstairs burnt. Or, once it was over, we laughed with Mom about how frantic she was. Humor was easier than acknowledging all of the “what ifs” and “unknowns” of the horrific incident. We were so accustomed to drama and trauma, our coping mechanisms kicked right in.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We later learned that the fire started by a flaw in the chimney which caused the how smoke to spread into the walls--a simple explanation. This event provided the perfect excuse for Mom and George to move us to Stevensville, even farther away from West Haven where my friends were. The next house was the same size, if not bigger than our Concord one. Life at this house created a new normal. It had even less property but for the first time in my life, I slept in my own bedroom. Having more personal space helped life feel a little less chaotic. We siblings could scatter and do our own things, meaning we fought much less. Mom, changing her ways more, enrolled my younger siblings into a Lutheran school down the street. With George’s painter salary and her rental business, I am not sure how they afforded the private education. My guess is that they received some sort of financial assistance. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Even so, Mom continued being unpredictable. Some days I came home and stuff would be changed around the house. Like the time when she got rid of our microwave because she suddenly believed it would give us cancer… then returned it a few weeks later when her episode passed. George was her new ally as she continued preparing for the end of the world. They began saving excessive amounts of water and nonperishable foods. They spoke of it constantly. But by this time I had largely overcame my fear of the end of the world and instead decided that I no longer wanted to know the details. Living in the moment felt safer. Besides, if the world ended, I wanted to end with it. There was no way I would care to live with everyone around me dead.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I spent most of that summer with friends and working a dairy bar, the famous ice cream shop in West Haven. I loved this job. It gave me independence and--just like peers at school--my coworkers loved me. When they noticed Mom being late picking me up, I opted for walking to a general store next door. Maybe then they wouldn’t pay attention. Always starving after my shifts, I used tips to buy crackers, candy, and soda. Then, I plopped onto the curb waiting for Mom to pick me up, sometimes for hours after dark and the store closing. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she arrived, I couldn’t hold back my emotions. At this age, her very presence annoyed me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Finally you’re here! Gosh Mom, you’re so embarrassing. What took you so long?” The attitude was mixed with grumbles and eye rolls.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know what Kelly, your brothers are right. You really are selfish and spoiled, you know that?! I didn’t have to come and get you! I have other stuff that I could be doing but you always need things to be your way, so here I am driving to West Haven to pick you up and the least you could do is say thank you.” Her high pitched screams stung my ears. When she spoke these words I hung my head in shame, too weak to hide my tears. No matter how I reacted, it felt wrong. I felt wrong. Here I was at age fourteen being responsible, working, and saving money, but still being shamed by her. Many of my friends’ parents would not only eagerly pick their children up from activities on time, but seemed genuinely happy and proud of them.  They seemed to actually enjoy spending time with their children.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Still, after so many years, I struggled to understand why Mom wouldn’t want to spend more time with me. It didn’t make sense why she abandoned me repeatedly. Her cruel response made things even more confusing. It was as if she were shouting “how dare you think that you deserve my love?” And that reality was nearly too hard to bear.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In her presence, I felt hopeless, but hid it well. Instead--like I did for all things unpleasant in my life--I suppressed the feelings and created a narrative that Mom and I were best friends. We had flaws like everyone does, but our relationship, as I would tell others, was “perfect”. Any negative feelings weren’t allowed. Sure, they slipped when my volcano erupted--like the times she was late--but when I could control it, I did. Because the real Kelly was too much for Mom. She was too much for anyone. 
									</p>
										~
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Throughout the summer Mom informed me I would be switching to Stevensville Public Schools. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I’m not.” was always my response when she brought it up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As summer came to an end, the conversations became more serious. “Kelly, you will be switching schools to Stevensville.” she informed me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! No! Mom, please! My friends are all I have. You can’t take me from school. You have to let me stay!” I was frantic. It was survival.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By this age, Mom and I fought constantly. If it wasn’t about her being late, it was about George. I couldn’t hide the disgust that I felt while he looked my young teenage body up and down. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, you’rrre so sexy just like your mommy, you know dat? You look just like herrr. Oh, Kelly, you’rrre just so sexy.” His eyes would be glowing with adoration.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shivers covered my whole body when he was around. “George, stop. Please stop. No. No. No. I don’t want a hug!” My voice was like a broken record, but it didn’t matter. He always approached, grabbed my face, and kissed it everywhere. His hands refused to stay put when he hugged me. It happened every time I saw him. I felt disgusted and enraged, especially when Mom watched and did nothing. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;With Mom’s lack of concern, I decided to be more direct. “Mom, George annoys me and makes me uncomfortable. He’s gross and always hugging and kissing me. And he smells bad. Can you just tell him to stop?” I plead with her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know Kelly, it’s just a Hungarian cultural thing. It’s how he shows love. He’s not like your dad who is always mean. He is nice to you, like a dad should be. You’re just not used to how a dad should love you yet.” she always reasoned.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, he’s in America now and needs to learn our way of doing things," I shot back.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;These conversations escalated into raging arguments. Mom and George were convinced that I was saying this to tear their relationship apart. The many times Sarah and Avalon voiced similar concerns they were always met with the same response.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m not trying to tear your relationship apart, I just don’t want him touching me.” I tried to help Mom understand, but it meant nothing. I always ended up in trouble for having an attitude. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One day, I walked in the front door to see George holding eight-year-old Avalon into a tight hug and the way he rubbed her bottom nauseated me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A few days later, after a grocery shopping trip, I mustered the courage to tell Mom. “Mom, the other day when I walked into the house George was holding Avalon in a hug and rubbing her butt. It made me uncomfortable and I didn’t like it.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Really? Are you sure? Are you sure he wasn’t just giving her a hug and it looked like something different?” she reasoned.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Maybe, but I think I’m sure. It looked weird.” I continued walking her step by step through what I saw.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, I’ll talk to him about it." She settled on an answer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I felt silly bringing it up, as if maybe something small was being made into something bigger. But a weight lifted from my shoulders after this conversation. She believed me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;George didn’t often become angry, but when he did, it was monstrous. Even larger than Dad. Or maybe it just felt that way because I didn’t yet know how to predict him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What! How dare she!” That night, I heard his voice all the way from their bedroom, located on the opposite end of the garage.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he reached me in the kitchen, his voice roared. “How darrre you ackuse me of touching Avalon’s butt?! Who do you dink you arrre to ackuse me of something like dat? Arrre you trying to make yourrr mommy mad at me?! You don’t like me so you’rrre just trying to starrrt fight betveen us! You vill never say something like dat about me again, do you hearrr me??!?” His face was so close that I felt his breath. I gagged at the smell of body odor and red wine breath.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My voice was shaking and stuttering. “You’re right. I’m sorry. I wasn’t trying to start anything between you and Mom. I must have thought I saw something that I didn’t.” I couldn’t hide my terror.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;George continued shouting but I didn’t stay to listen. Instead, I sprinted the front porch where I drowned myself in uncontrollable tears. <i>Why didn’t Mom have my back?</i> I wondered. <i>She just stood there and let him yell at me.</i> Her betrayal didn’t make sense. It seemed that she put us in unsafe situations over and over again. Not only did she ignore our constant cries for help, but turned the blame toward us. Putting us in shitty circumstances wasn’t enough, she had to rub our face in it. I settled on one thought that day: FUCK MOM. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Still, it wasn’t but a few days later that I had again convinced myself that Mom and I were best friends. “Mom isn’t an evil person, she is a broken person who has suffered a lot of abuse by Dad. She can’t help the way she is. Besides, at the end of the day she knows me better than anyone and I do believe she loves me.” These ideas settled into my brain. That way, I wouldn’t have to address the fact that it felt Mom didn’t love me. I always had a knack for creating a happy story, just like with the pigs and ducks and dogs.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;With this mindset, Mom raved about me to people, even telling me in private that I was her favorite kid. This “friendship” meant that we really “got” each other. So when I convinced her that we could both have what we wanted, she joyously agreed. I would remain in the West Haven Public School district, so long as I stayed with other family members so that she wouldn’t need to drive me thirty minutes to school.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was thrilled. I won. After my parents divorce, Mom remarrying and a house fire, being near my friends was how I would survive. Sure, I performed and put on an “everything is perfect” face for peers. But that’s exactly what I needed. Safety in their presence--no abuse, lies or mind games.

									<h2><i>Tangled</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Over the next four years, I navigated my way through a new world. No matter how much effort was put into school, my grades hovered mostly around Cs and Ds. In the classroom, I learned history, science, literature and more for the first time. It seemed my peers who began young were gradually building off of material from the years prior. Not only was I playing catch-up, but my struggles with reading comprehension were impeding me. I read the words, but couldn’t make sense of what it meant. My brain was everywhere and nowhere at the same time--sometimes spiraling on unrelated thoughts going a hundred miles per hour, refusing to settle on just one. Other times it felt as if I were dazed, distant, and completely blank—disappearing into my mind until something brought me back to the present moment. Should someone ask what I had been thinking about, there was no telling them, as I truly didn’t know. Needless to say, there was an inability to connect with text and classroom instruction. When teachers became frustrated, I felt just as upset with myself as they were. There was so much shame from inadequacy and failing despite hard efforts.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I worked hard to hide my insecurity with fake confidence, even convincing myself that school didn’t matter to me. Instead, I focused my energy where I could succeed: socially. Connection became all I needed. Mom gave me two living options for continuing in West Haven Public Schools. “You can either live with your Dad or Josiah. Those are the options. If you aren't living with me, you have to be with family.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah married his girlfriend shortly before their son was born, but he was leaving for a nine month deployment in Iraq. Being much more terrified of Dad, staying with Josiah's wife and baby became the better option. Their place was a home base where I went to change out overnight clothes. Otherwise, I often ventured out with friends. Once Josiah returned, Grandma Williams house became home. As long as I stayed with family, Mom didn’t care, and Grandma’s only rule was that she know my whereabouts. A simple text stating “I’m staying at Shannon’s tonight!” or “Staying with Jami!” would suffice. When returning home, it never mattered what substances I had been using because she slept soundly. Plus, her television blared loud enough to drown any noise.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The setup was great until one day, grandma approached me with concern.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, I noticed that you have never asked me to buy you feminine hygiene products and when I clean the bathroom I never see them in the trash. Are you not having your period? I’m thinking I might need to take you to see a doctor to make sure that nothing is wrong.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Blood rushes to my face and my feet shift uncomfortably. No one has spoken to me about my period. At nearly fifteen years old, many of my friends have gotten theirs and I have wondered myself whether something is wrong with me. But a doctor? Going would feel like disrespecting Mom, as she forbids it. Then another thought settles, <i>what if they did discover that something is wrong with me?</i> Or worse, <i>what if someone notices what Josiah has been doing to me for so many years? Would that cause something to be wrong?</i> Suddenly, grandma is too close to every deep rooted fear of mine. It feels humiliating.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Noticing sounds distancing and tunnel vision setting in, I respond fast, desperate to silence the conversation triggering such uncomfortable emotions.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No gram, I’m good. I’m fine. I don’t need to go to the doctor or for you to buy me anything.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you sure? Because you’re a little bit older now and that can sometimes mean that something is wrong medically. I will at least buy some to keep under the bathroom sink for you.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I’m sure.” Not waiting for her response, I plop onto the couch behind me and dive into homework.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As week’s follow, the interaction lingers. One night, while applying red polish on my nails, an idea forms that will put grandma’s suspicions to rest. She is already asleep when I tuck the nail polish container into my pocket and disappear into the bathroom. For one week each month after, I will brush polish on the pads and wrap them with toilet paper. Grandma will learn that I have a healthy body and my secret once again belongs to me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During this time, even my friends' families accepted me as their own. Their parents transported me places and cheered me on at basketball and soccer events. If they made their kid a sign, I received one too and their celebratory dinners always included me. I could show up to their houses any day, any time, no questions asked. It was common for my friends' parents to return from work finding me on their couch watching television or napping. They were excited to see me, thrilled to share their food. Most of them knew my Mom and had even argued with her about neglectful parenting. All to no avail. Beyond that, my couch-surfing was a “don’t ask, don’t tell” type of situation.  
									</p>
										~
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The next summer, at fifteen years old, Demi invites me to her grandparent’s cottage. I love visiting this cozy place on an inland lake in northern Michigan. Most days, we ride tubes behind her dad’s boat. As we rip through waves, the muscles in our hands cramp from clenching the handles as her dad playfully tries to flip us. It is a competition--just like when we tread water out deep, seeing who can last the longest. When night falls, we sneak alcohol from her dad’s cooler and dance to the latest songs, like the “Sexy Can I” while talking about boys.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Suddenly, I am doing all of the “normal” things that other kids my age do. Experiencing the very world I have imagined my friends living for so many years.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Even better, or so I thought at the time, no one cared about my whereabouts. Not only do I feel grown-up and more independent, but it is as if I have gained control over my life for the first time ever. Energy can be spent with people of my choosing, wearing what I want, and partaking in many different types of social gatherings. Yet, underneath it all is a continued aching feeling to be cherished, nurtured, noticed, and taught by a responsible thoughtful parent. Perhaps educated on things like how to handle my first period.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately, it comes just before the trip to Demi’s cottage and I don’t have the slightest clue what to do. Mom wears pads, but those are bulky, like wearing a diaper--and the mess feels overwhelming. After some embarrassing attempts at inserting a tampon, I eventually master it in time for the cottage.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Disposing of my tampons becomes another hiccup throughout my process: <i>I can’t flush it because that could clog the toilet,</i> I think. <i></i>I don’t want to waste toilet paper by constantly wrapping all of these.</i> I sit debating before tossing the bloody tampon straight into the trash. No toilet paper waste, no toilet clogs. I imagine how dad would be proud for me taking his lessons into consideration: “Never put anything but toilet paper in the toilet. Not even a paper towel,” were his words, and of course I know from the one wasted egg incident that he is not about waste. Based on my experiences, the decision feels right.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;That is, until the end of the week. While packing to leave, Demi’s dad approaches us. “So, uhm, someone is going to need to change the bathroom trash. And I’m thinking it should beeeee…” He pauses uncomfortably, uncertain how to finish. “You.” He points toward me. Demi glances over and immediately I know—there is a bloody mess in the bathroom making people uncomfortable.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Most women had parents teaching them about periods, tampons and proper disposal methods. Yet here I was, trying to be perfect without proper instruction and completely failing. I hated my parents for it, especially that they weren’t there to scream at during such instances.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>Never will I make this mistake again,</i> I think to myself. Slowly, the anxious brain from a neglected childhood has begun to accept that she is on her own for survival in this new world. She will learn by carefully watching others, not her family. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My smoking, drinking, and illegal drug use increased rapidly. The first time using marijuana was strange, as I stood outside with a couple of friends while they taught me about the smoking device they created out of a plastic water bottle. This flashed my mind back to a young childhood memory.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Glen's mom, whom we called Tiny, lived in a trailer down the road from ours. Her short stature caused difficulty in her driving, even with pillows stacked on her seat. Doing her grocery shopping was Mom’s godly duty, always making sure she was stocked on milk and cigarettes. Beside her mobile home sat a run-down schoolhouse and an abandoned church.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One day, Glen's son Charlie, Abe, and I rode our bikes to the abandoned church were we sat in a small room with a coffee table and some chairs.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look what I brought? It’s my dad’s.” Charlie held a smoking pipe and Abe sat beside him with an excited nervousness.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After holding it up and lighting something in it, Charlie inhaled and coughed. “See, you just smoke it like that.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We passed it around for a bit and although I attempted to smoke, there was no need to cough like they did. <i>Was I doing it wrong?</i> I wondered.
									</p>
										~
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Now a teenager standing with my friends, Jeff and Shannon, as they teach me about “weed,” I wonder if this was what I had smoked as a little girl.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This night, I don’t experience giggles from being high like my friends but instead sleep on the couch for hours. It’s as if my body has relaxed enough to catch up on many years of missed rest.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My next time smoking proved to be even better than the first time and for years after, I desired to re-experience it forever. Never had my body laughed harder or felt so connected with those around me. No whirling thoughts or tension, just feelings of enjoyment with my pack of friends. It was as if something had been lacking in my life--true happiness. Yet I never knew anything was missing until the experience. It was better than drinking, cigarettes, and even the different pills we took. Some of the pills were euphoric, but it was false happiness and even in that, a pit remained in my stomach as I anticipated the euphoria ending. They felt like something I could become too dependent on, which was scary. Marijuana left no crash or hangover, at least initially. There was no fear, just the good parts of Kelly and it quickly became my drug of choice.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Some of my friends' parents didn’t care about our substance use. “I would rather you do it here and know you are safe then have you out who-knows-where getting into trouble," they reasoned. My friends and I gravitated toward those homes. No matter what, we stayed together. On weekends we told each parent we were staying at another friends house and hit up parties around town or, on some occasions headed to college parties.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Some parents worried about us. Like that time we woke up after an intense night of partying to an intervention from Shannon’s parents and multiple members of the local Baptist Church. It was not good for the hangover. Shannon and my parents met through homeschool groups when we were four years old, and our mothers shared some similar religious beliefs, so a stern talking-to by concerned Christians was nothing new. We later got high and laughed it off.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Even though I heard that Shannon’s dad could be abusive like mine, I never witnessed it and he was like a father to me, one of those many parents taking me in and cheering me on at athletic events. Here Shannon and I were, so many years since she saved me from the swing rope, still close friends, both addicted to drugs.
		
										&emsp;&emsp;The unpredictability of parties makes me nervous, but I need to stay near my people. One night particularly challenges my anxiety when Shannon and I attend a party. It’s at a trailer with overcrowded rooms and stuffy smoke filled air. Throughout the night, there’s a guy who won’t stop talking to me. He’s tall, muscular, and much older, maybe even nineteen or twenty  years old. It’s not what he says that makes me uncomfortable, but the way he stares my body up and down with lust. Each time I walk away from him to socialize with others, he follows, standing so close that I can smell the liquor, cologne, and sweat coming from his body. <i>Oh boy, it’s going to be one of those nights where an annoying guy won’t leave me alone,</i> I think to myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, I step away to use the bathroom and when finished, he’s waiting for me outside the door. Pushing past him, I head back toward the hall for the living room. Before I make it, he grabs and shoves me against the wall. I'm pinned. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, wait! Stop. Stop. Stop. I said stop!” My voice shakes with panic. I wiggle in attempts to free myself but he’s too strong. I twist my head back and forth to avoid his kisses, trying to gain control of my thoughts enough to make an escape plan.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Luckily, his mom hears and comes out of her bedroom. “What are you doing?!” she shouts, then they switch their argument to Spanish and he loosens his grip enough for me to escape down the hallway.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Shannon, we have to leave. Now!” My voice is desperate.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In this moment, I need her to know the seriousness of what has happened without causing a scene. She is our designated driver this night which means no drinking, but we were nearly always high while driving.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She laughs, “Hold on. We will go in a little while. They are rolling a blunt right now. Here, smoke with us.” She pats the cushion next to her. I am high and drunk as can be, but fear has sobered me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Knowing that I am the anxious one when we are out, she probably thinks my usual nerves are kicking in rather than something actually being wrong. Parties cause tremors throughout my entire body no matter how many substances I use. The fear can’t be buried and she is right, there isn’t always a known cause. 	
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Thinking back, I know it was a fear of being near drunk males, getting into trouble by the police, or something erratic happening because the environment felt eerily similar to my own family and past traumas. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Fear of punishment by authority figures. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Fear of sexual abuse by men who wouldn’t control themselves. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Fear of abandonment by family members or close party friends. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Fear of people objectifying my body. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the time, I didn’t make all these connections but just felt embarrassed at the inability to relax like my friends.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Shannon, I’m being serious. That guy that I told you about just waited for me outside the bathroom and shoved me against the wall. He kept kissing me, and I begged him to stop but he wouldn’t. He was going to rape me but his mom came out and helped me. We need to go. Now.” My heart pounds so fast it throbs in my head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ugh, okay, we will go just after I finish smoking.” She looks annoyed, as if I have inconvenienced her fun.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, I need to get out of this house. Give me your keys, I’m going to wait in the car.” I'm annoyed at her lack of care, but reflecting as an adult, this was true to her behavior. The friendship was a continued cycle of abusive relationship dynamics I experienced within my own family.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Thinking back, going to the car alone wasn’t a smart choice. The house was suffocating me into an anxiety attack where fear became overwhelming, breathing got heavy, limbs trembled uncontrollably, dizziness set in with a feeling of detachment, followed by an unrelenting chest pain. The same episodes I had when Mom would abandon me as a kid--or when someone would vomit. What others thought was me overreacting and being annoying, was actually intense anxiety attacks that I was experiencing regularly. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I hope that going to the car will speed Shannon up, but also need to disappear and calm my anxiety away from the gaze of others. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The guy instantly follows me outside, grabbing my hand as he walks by. I turn back toward the door but as my hand tries to escape, he yanks with such force that I fall down the iced steps. As I frantically crawl away with him grabbing at me, his mom appears from the doorway, buying my freedom to rush back into the mobile home.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my left, Shannon smokes on the couch and on my right, another friend Harper plays beer pong in the kitchen. Harper is smart and logical, she will help. I am certain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After sharing my experience, she links our arms and holds me close. We snatch empty beer bottles from the kitchen table to keep as protection, should anyone follow us. Then, we lock ourselves in the car while waiting for Shannon. The man and his friend stand outside the vehicle door, but we crunch onto the floor, attempting to disappear in the shadows.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;That night, we made it out safely. The strange man nearly got the sexual encounter he wanted with me through using aggressive force, what I now know would be considered sexual assault. There is so much I didn’t understand about that incident at the time. There were no connections made with my childhood abuse because Josiah wasn’t aggressive or forceful during times when he was touching me. No one taught me how to keep my body safe or what to do if I were assaulted, with either a stranger or someone I knew. I realized, of course, that the assault was wrong, but it never occurred to me to call the police on this stranger at a party, just like it never once occurred to me to tell the authorities or any adult about my brother. 
									</p>
										~
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As junior year rolls around, something changes in me. No longer desiring the freedom of doing what I want, my anxiety craves routine and expectations. The chaos is too overwhelming.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad has recently remarried and from what I know, my stepmom, Sylvia, seems enjoyable. She is a nurse at a hospital and owns a well kept house, with hobbies of gardening in the backyard and painting birdhouses.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Although Dad rarely contacts us kids, there was a shift in him after the divorce. He sought therapy, drinks less, and to my knowledge, has never again laid a hand on any of us. <i>Maybe he was only mean because of a toxic marriage,</i> I hope, but these are only words Dad has fed me. His excuse for the abuse. Now, desperate for family normalcy, I long for them to be true so at the age of sixteen, I move in with him and Sylvia. At first, it almost feels normal. Each day, I receive a text from Sylvia “Kelly, will you be home tonight? If so, I will make you dinner!” Even though she doesn’t eat dinner herself, she always cooks me fresh meals when home. Dad also cares about my whereabouts. He texts stuff like “I need to know where you are Kelly,” and although I can imagine the critical tone, it doesn’t matter because he cares enough to text. He thinks of me and I ache for these small gestures like a baby yearns for its mother. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During this time, I isolated myself from friends. Between school, soccer, and waitressing, my schedule was busy, which gave good excuses. My friends knew better and reached out with messages of love and concern with their lack of hearing from me. Shannon however, became particularly hurt by my disappearance, feeling betrayed and abandoned by me. I felt guilty for not having a better reason other than “I just want to be alone.” Taking care of my friends as I had with my Mom meant years of abandoning myself to care for others. I was exhausted. Not just exhausted, but deeply depressed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My cigarette and marijuana addictions have grown and I’m officially a high functioning “pothead,” smoking before school, at lunchtime, after school, before bed, and even more if I have the opportunity. Nothing compares to the end of the day when I return home high as a kite after Dad and Sylvia are in bed. On the living room couch with the wood burning stove still heating the house, I switch on one of four shows: <i>Friends, Burlesque, SpongeBob or Tangled.</i> Dad hates my shows, criticizing them anytime they are on, as he prefers that I watch the movies he showed me as a little girl about conspiracies, war, and doomsday but those scare me too much.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;So at night, while the rest of the world sleeps, I settle into myself. It is the only time I can let my guard down. The dark thoughts creep in and I welcome them, summoning the little girl inside of me who is desperate to be seen--to be heard, loved and valued. I feed her candy, chocolate milk, and her favorite shows. When she becomes scared, I smoke more, calming her pain and fears the only way I know how.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One night, my phone pulls me from a sleep. It is late, well after midnight and a show sounds from the television. Per usual, I had passed out on Dad’s living room couch. My heart pounds when the phone reads: “Incoming Call from Sarah Cole”. She never calls in the night.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Hello?” My voice is tired and groggy.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly?” She whispers, so quiet I could have imagined it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sarah? Is that you? What’s wrong? Is everything okay?!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Can you please come pick me up?” As she speaks, I hears something in the background: George shouting and things slamming.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, of course. I’m on my way. Where are you?! What’s happening?!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m hiding in the basement. It’s George. I got an attitude with him so he freaked out, hit me, and won’t stop yelling. He’s going crazy. Kelly, I’m scared," she whimpers, as if holding back tears. It is a twenty minute drive and I long for it to be faster.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Do I need to call the police?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t think so. Just come. Come quick Kelly, I’m really scared.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I rush to Dad’s room, certain to whisper from the door and not wake him too abruptly. “Dad.” I’m quiet, but he still jumps from bed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, Kelly, what is it?” He tries to be concerned, but even this sounds harsh. His tone is never right.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It’s Sarah. She called and asked me to pick her up. Something about George being mad. I could hear him in the background yelling. I’m going to pick her up and we will come right back here," I explain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Thinking back, I don’t know why Dad let me leave. It doesn’t make sense why he didn’t come to the rescue, but for whatever reason, he didn’t.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Earlier that year, Mom and George had moved to a duplex with my younger siblings. It was so small that someone nearly always had to sleep on the living room couch or floor but after living in the trailer, this didn’t seem abnormal to anyone.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I arrive at their duplex, every light remains on and the front door lies wide open, not a single person in sight. I enter cautiously, ready to press “call” on the “9-1-1” which is already dialed into my phone, but there is still no movement. Even the mice are silent. Once inside, I notice a hole the size of a fist in the bathroom door, with a bigger one below. I will later learn that the bathroom door was smashed in by George while Sarah hid from him on the other side.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sarah heard my arrival and meets me in the kitchen. Now, she lets the tears flow. I hug her, then Mom enters from her bedroom, also crying. Then Daniel comes from the attic, both crying and shaking.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Where’s Avalon?!” Now I’m shivering. Why hasn’t she appeared?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know. She must be hiding. When he went crazy all of us hid," Sarah explains as she catches her breaths. We divide up and begin a search. Somehow, she is in the first place I check, tucked as far back into a deep closet as she can get. It’s exactly where I would have hidden. Digging through clothes, I reach her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Avalon? Is that you?!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly?” Her voice is innocent, afraid.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, Avalon, it’s me. It’s safe. George is gone. You can come out now.” She is ten years old now, but in this moment, I see her as the vulnerable toddler who needed my protection for so many years. Her gentle cries and insecure body show that she feels like the little girl I imagined. She crawls into my arms and I hold her shivering body close to mine. Everyone is safe, physically, but the emotional trauma remain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sarah, you should not have gotten an attitude with George like that. You need to apologize when he gets home," Mom begins. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! God Mom, you’re so annoying! No fucking way!” I can’t contain my rage. “Sarah, you do not need to apologize for anything. There is no reason for George to be breaking shit and hurting people. If anyone owes someone an apology, it’s him! What is wrong with you Mom?!” I know that shouting, saying “God” and cursing will piss her off--and I don’t care. I feel the strongest need to protect my little siblings and the way they huddle close shows that they welcome the security.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Over the years, my brothers had formed two new ideas about me. They now made comments about me being a “slut” for wearing makeup and tight jeans. Remarks also came about how much of a “bitch” I was for being assertive with Mom. I was not having sex with multiple people but they were right about one thing, the undeniable hatred that spewed out when Mom angered me. She brought out my worst side and I wanted to hurt her in the same depth she hurt me. Maybe then she could understand and finally see me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I finish, Mom becomes small, preparing to make herself into the victim. Her voice falls. “You know what, you’re right. I don’t know why George gets so angry like that. He really only gets mad when he drinks too much wine. Maybe I made a mistake. Maybe this is God punishing me for getting a divorce from your dad. This really is all my fault. I mess everything up. Nobody really loves me…” Abe arrives just in time to take over. Feeling annoyed and ready to leave, I invite any siblings who want to remain safe. It is the same game, but a different day. This day, I came to save my siblings, not Mom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Following incidences such as this, Mom moved on as if nothing happened. Should one of us try to have a constructive follow up conversation, she denied any incident. The next day, this would be in the past and she would treat me once again as her “best friend”. I struggled to make sense of it. It was, what Mom is most talented at and what I had called, the biggest “mind fuck”. Yet I always caved and went along with it, attempting to soak up any small feelings of affection, which wasn’t all fake. I did empathize with how difficult it must be to raise so many children alone with limited resources while experiencing abuse. When we were best friends, I really felt her love, desiring to hold the moments forever while knowing that no matter what they wouldn’t last because at any given moment, she would return to a state of anger, manipulation, and overall unpredictability.
									</p>

									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The first few months at Dad’s were fine, until they weren’t. One day, he raged at me. I cannot remember what it was about, maybe chores or forgetting to text him my whereabouts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As he shouts, I become cornered in the kitchen. Despite his heavy drinking, Dad is aging well and at fifty five years, he has few gray hairs, some faint wrinkles around his eyes, and still wears the same leather belt. Not much has changed. Like usual when he shouts, my head feels hazy and disconnected, unable to fully hear his words. Then it tunes back in, “And why do you always act like you’re scared of me or something?! Huh? Why Kelly? Why?” he barks, demanding an answer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For the first time with him, I gained a voice. Usually, I stuttered around Dad, especially when he was angry. In my mind--and I imagine in his--this proved that I really was a “stupid little retard” just as he said.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This day, Looking straight into his dark eyes as he towers over me, I speak clear and steady, “I act like I’m scared of you, because I am scared of you Dad.” For the first time ever he sees a glimpse of me. Stuttering was instinctual, but this response is a choice. A vulnerable and honest choice.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my surprise, his face changes and almost softens. He steps back, pausing to think. It’s a look I haven’t seen before. <i>Is he having a realization? Does he finally get it?</i> I wonder. Not staying to receive an answer, I sprint to my room and lock the door, taking their dog with me to hide under the covers while my trembling body fights to regain steady breath.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;All the while thinking: <i>He paused. He stepped back. He heard you, saw you, and listened.</i> It gives me hope.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometime later, I sit in a bubble bath. It is the only thing that stops the shivers that come with my anxiety. Suddenly, shouting sounds from the living room. Dad’s voice is clear but there is another male. “I’m gonna put you in a fucking ditch!” This man shouts, just as scary as Dad. Even in the bath, I freeze like a deer in headlights, ready to hide if need be. That is how on guard I always feel. When the shouting stops, I exit the bath and dress quickly, curious to know what happened.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In the living room Dad rambles on about Sylvia’s youngest son, Jay, who is around the age of thirty years old. “That guy is on cocaine and all kinds of other drugs! Who does he think he is to come into my house threatening me!” His voice explodes. Sylvia follows like a lost puppy, trying to calm him but not knowing how.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“That’s it, I’m done. I’m getting a restraining order against him!” I step back as Dad’s eyes turn toward me. “You! You were here. You heard him, right? You’ll come and be my witness," he commands.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I know what restraining order means, but witness? What is that? When it is all Dad grumbles about for days, I quickly learn. When he coaches me on what to say, I really understand.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Previously Dad always taught me to run from the police, the court, and the government. “The government is trying to control us and if they can, they will put chips in us to do so. Bad guys. That’s what they are. If they show up at the house, lock the door and pretend you’re not home. Grab my pistol from under the mattress if you have to.” His instructions were always clear but this testifying in court goes against that. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The days leading up to court, I practice my testimony out loud and in my head constantly. <i>This is it, my chance to prove myself to Dad. To prove that I can be on his side. Then, he will no longer be angry toward me about anything,</i> I convince myself. If only I perfect this testimony, then I can be loved.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is my first time in a courtroom and I find it interesting that other people sit listening while waiting for their own trials. On the stand, I answer the questions asked in front of the strangers. When probed about my perspective of what happened, I tell them. “Well, I was in the bath and heard yelling but it didn’t sound like my dad so...” Having prepared for hours and days, I finish, answering any and all of their questions with complete confidence. I perform even better than I wanted, I was perfect.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When they decline Dad’s personal protection order, he shouts at the judge about the injustice, nearly getting himself arrested. On the walk to the car, he continues rambling. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“And you!” He shouts flailing his arms as I shamefully walk behind him. “You went up there and said you heard yelling but it didn’t sound like your dad's voice. That was you telling them that you’re used to hearing me yell! You told them I’m a mean person! You are the reason they didn’t give me the protection order!” He rages. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Now I am the lost puppy, insecurely wanting to take his anger away and calm him without the slightest clue how. So, I remain silent with my head down. What I feel even stronger, is the shame. The disappointment. I tried hard. Did my best and still, he hates me to a point of angry disgust.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I wanted to believe his anger came from a toxic marriage but instead, after just turning seventeen, I knew that dysfunction married dysfunction. And they had a bunch of kids. <i>What would that mean for me?</i>

									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;In late winter of my junior year, George announced a last-minute extravagant-for-us spring break vacation. On a weekend visit home, before they had moved into the duplex, we stood in the spacious dining room of the biggest house I had ever lived. For years he made it his goal to give us a rich life. On his painter’s salary, I knew that this house was above he and Mom’s pay grade. They were still against public schools, and pouring unholy amounts money into my little sibling’s private Lutheran education. At just barely seventeen, I knew they were wasting money that they did not have on this vacation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Regardless, excitement grew as I anticipated my first ever real vacation. The type of trip that some of my friends went on regularly with their families.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ve arrre going de be on de beach and eat expensive foood!” George’s Hungarian accent is strong. His green eyes glow the way that Mom’s do when she acts on impulses. We are to spend a week in Florida with an added cruise trip to the Bahamas.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, I am so excited!”  Jittery with emotion, I am already planning my wardrobe, hair, and makeup styles.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Enjoying my excitement, George approaches for a hug and a sadistic smile forms on his face as he admires my body. I feel naked. My hands guard the front of my chest, preparing to shove him away. Instead, I freeze and let out an uncomfortable laugh while he kisses my face repeatedly. His prickly facial hairs scratch like sandpaper and I’m Gagging at the strong stench of body odor, desperate to scrub myself in the shower the moment it’s over.
									</p>

									<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In Florida, we park outside the fanciest hotel that I have ever seen. “This is not the hotel that we are staying at. We just need to run in and talk to some people about a timeshare," Mom explains. The lobby has spotless bright red carpet, shimmering chandeliers, and a flawless view of the Atlantic Ocean.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sarah, Daniel, Avalon, and I waited on a couch while Mom and George inform the front desk of our arrival. Upon returning, Mom instructs us to put on our swimsuits. “They have a beautiful outdoor pool and beach that you can swim in while waiting for us!” We are directed past the pool and to the beach.  It is beautiful and we share excitement for our first ocean experience. “We will not be gone long, I promise! We will be back in an hour," mom assures us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My siblings and I stare at each other awkwardly, uncertain what to do. With me being the oldest, I take initiative in scoping the area to make a plan. It is about 9am and the pool is already crowded with swimmers and guests at the minibar. The beach being more open feels easier for us to stay together safely. We pick a spot in the sand, slap on a quick coat of sunscreen and head for the water.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Hours pass and despite my calls and texts, there has been no word from Mom and George.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Rotating between the beach and pool, we fill the first few hours with made up games, picture taking, people watching, and chattering about what to expect on a cruise ship. By afternoon, we all feel bored, wandering aimlessly trying to manage our worries and frustrations about being left alone in an unfamiliar place. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Hunger and thirst overcome the boredom as we ache to see our guardians again. My sister and I take turns wandering inside in search of Mom and George without success. Finally, at about 4:30pm, they return.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, where were you guys?” Irritation rattles in my voice. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Did you have fun?! We can start our vacation now!” She exclaims.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My siblings walk silently behind me, knowing that I am the strongest voice for handling such situations. “Ya, but we are hot, hungry, and tired! Why didn’t you answer our calls and texts?” My frustration builds.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Let’s go to our hotel and get dinner.” Mom and Georges smiles show that they are not acknowledging our anger.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sarah and I glance at each other, sharing eye rolls. <i>What the heck is wrong with them?</i> Silent words transfer between us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom and George walk with excitement, oblivious about abandoning their four children for seven hours in a strange place with no food, water, or money while they were undoubtedly wined and dined in a condo sales pitch. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Piling into the clunky minivan, George says that he will be stopping for wine. He has set his mind to a specific type of drink that he struggles to find, despite searching multiple stores. My sunburn felt excruciatingly hot and my bones ache. With no air conditioning in the van, sweat dribbles down my legs.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh my God, seriously? You’re stopping at another store?” My weariness grows with exhaustion. This doesn’t feel like a vacation. So far, it seems like hell. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, just one morrre storrre.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You literally said that three stores ago… but sure, don’t worry about us so long as you have your stupid wine.” My eyes close and I cover my face in attempts to soothe a pulsing headache.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Before fully processing my words, George plummets into an unmanageable rage. “You vill not talk to me and yourrr Mommy that way! Who do you dink you arrre?! Cahming on ourrr vacation and talking to us vit no rrrespect!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I am not trying to be rude. But seriously we are hot and tired a…”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Shut up! You arrre kid! You valk arrround dinking you’rrrre queen of  vorld…” His words shift into unrecognizable Hungarian.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When the van stops my mind returns from its fog. “Vit out! Vit out of my van right now!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No.” I respond fearlessly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I said vit out!” He demands.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My eyes meet Mom’s, “Mom, I don’t have to get out of the car, right? I wasn’t trying to have an attitude! I am just really irritated and don’t feel well!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, Kelly, you shouldn’t have gotten an attitude with him. Apologize and you can stay.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! You’re taking his side?!” She never would have taken Dad’s side when he treated us like this. I would not have needed to scream at him in the first place because she would have taken that role for me. I hate George and what he has done to my mom. She makes excuses to justify his abuse yet chastises my attitude when I’m sick. “He literally just yelled so much worse than my attitude and is telling me to get out of the car. I will not apologize.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, if you want to stay, you need to apologize.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I am not apologizing. I hate you. I hate you so much Mom! I wish you had never given birth to me in the first place. I wish I was dead so that I never had to live in this stupid world with you.” My words are meant to hurt, as I’m searching for the sharpest sword to depict my feelings. If it stabs hard enough, maybe then she will understand the extent of my pain. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Vat did you just say to her?!” Turning in his seat, I look into the eyes of Satan himself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I will not be controlled.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Spit spews through clenched teeth and raging words. His arms swat the air in attempts to whack me behind his seat but I’m quicker at dodging, cowering just out of his reach. When he slides the door beside me open, my feet and eyes return to the floor, afraid. No longer daring to look at him. “Don’t touch me George. I didn’t mean it. I really didn’t mean it. Please, I didn’t mean it. Just please don’t touch me.” I squirm as he reaches me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When his hand makes contact with my sunburnt back, a screech of excruciating pain leaves my lips. This is the first time any of us have witnessed George’s physical violence, taking place even before the incident in which Sarah had called for help.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Grabbing my arm, he drags me from the van, gives a shove, returns to his seat, and leaves with my family.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I sit on a curb in defeat attempting to control my tears. The sunburn still hurts and I’m unsure if my limbs are shaking from scorching physical pain or intense anxiety. Perhaps it is both.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, you need to make a plan," I tell myself out loud while forcing slow deep breaths in and out. Looking up, I struggle to smell through my now stuffy nose. Finally, I feel the warm sun hit my face, followed by the light smell of fresh tar, a sure sign of regaining control. Scoping my surroundings, the parking lot is empty with a few run-down businesses. Traffic shuffles by behind me but otherwise, there’s not a single person in sight. <i>I wonder if they will come back for me. If not, I will walk somewhere to get help. I will call Dad. He will freak when he hears how another man treated his daughter.</i> I strategize.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The thoughts of them not returning brings shivers. Hugging my legs closely, I rest my head on my knees and allow silent tears to flow again. Being abandoned in a vacant parking lot is not what I had imagined for the first day of my first vacation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Ten to fifteen minutes later, they return and mom exits the van to sit next to me. <i>Yes,</i> I think, <i>Now I have her alone. I can make her understand and she will comfort me.</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You need to go apologize to George.” My thoughts are interrupted.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What, are you kidding me?! No, Mom. I will not apologize to him.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, that is the only way that he will let you back in the car.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Then I will find my own way home because I am not apologizing to him.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look Kelly, I do not know why George gets angry like this. But I do know that you should not have gotten an attitude with him. You need to tell him that you are sorry.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, Mom caves, and I am allowed back into the van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the hotel, George packs his bags and mom catches me alone. “George says that he is buying a plane ticket home and will only stay if you apologize. Just go tell him you are sorry Kelly. Your attitude is ruining this vacation.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We debate and compromise, I would apologize to George if he also apologizes to me. Mom agrees, only if I go first. With shame and embarrassment I fight every instinct in me to force the words out. “I am sorry for getting an attitude with you George.” I speak, just above a whisper.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh Kelly, I love you! Come herrre and give me kisses.” I step back but not quick enough to escape his lips.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My apology from him was never given.
									</p>
										~
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The first day on the cruise ship feels surreal. I am uncertain as to whether it is from being on the ship itself, or because sickness and exhaustion from the sunburn have put me in a permanent dreamlike state. We arrive at our tiny ship cabin that has two half-sized bunk beds. To our relief, Mom and George have a private room of their own.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I remove my flip phone from my pocket and plop onto a bottom bunk. At the age of fifteen, two years prior, I began waitressing at West Haven’s local Chinese restaurant. My boss, Jenn, had begun playing a motherly role in my life. Being on the ocean means that I can not have contact with her for multiple days due to lack of cellular connection. My chest is heavy as I anticipate being away from my safety net, both friends and Jenn. I send quick text updates, leaving out the tragic events from the day before. Desperate to not overwhelm her, I speak of the beauty on the cruise ship and send lots of love.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Staring out the cabin window, I can’t help but notice my burning skin, throbbing head, and aching body. “Common’, let’s go explore and find the pool!” Sarah, Daniel, and Avalon plead with excitement. This is potentially my only chance of being on a cruise ship. A once in a lifetime experience. Eager to enjoy it, I shove my pain aside to engage in all of the activities with a sense of happiness.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By the time the cruise ship returns, massive blisters have formed on my face and arms, one being so big that it takes up the entirety of my forehead. Constant nausea makes eating unthinkable. My body screams for rest, but the burning skin will not allow me to even touch the bedsheets. Cool baths lose the battle in reducing the heat on my skin, a the water turns instantly hot. I continue shaking with feverish chills as I stand naked in the bathroom. Nothing feels comfortable, everything hurt. I know that I need a hospital but do not dare speak it, for every emotion must remain inside, buried deep.

									<h2><i>Corbin</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;That spring I moved back in with Grandma Williams, who welcomed me with open arms. Mom had desired me to help with the siblings and Dad aimed to control. Grandma suffered from loneliness so I kept her company when able. With having a baby to care for, Lesley, Josiah's wife, required a sitter. Every living option came with terms and although earning my place was understandable, no one truly saw me. Grandma Williams’ became the best choice due to our mutual desire for connection.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Two of my friends, Shannon and Cassie  assisted with the move from Dad’s. I imagine moving abruptly hurt he and Sylvia, but didn’t have the words for what I was experiencing at the time, aside from an urgency to disappear.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Back at Grandma’s, things continued as usual. Each morning she woke at 5am and switched the news on, which had primarily bad reports, which created a similar discomfort to when Dad spoke of government conspiracies. After catching her morning report, she headed for the computer to play solitaire. Although she had some piano students, most of her energy was poured into quilting and writing. “I am writing a novel! It is about a Romanian man falling in love with an American woman!” Her smile widened as she spoke of her work. For many years, she had dated a Romanian man, adoring his accent and accordion-playing skills. The hypnotizing way she spoke of him reminded me of how Mom looked at George, leaving a pit in my stomach. “My novel has too many adult scenes though so you cannot read it until you are an adult," she explained. To my knowledge, it was never finished, but I imagine the act of writing provided purpose for her life throughout those years.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Around this time I had begun a similar journey--the search for purpose, which first required belonging. Friends filled this need, with one thing setting me apart, they were all having sex. They looked at males with googly eyes and kept tallies of each one they slept with, raving about who had the best orgasm. Not only did I not desire sex, but struggled to engage in the conversations.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Corbin, my on and off again boyfriend since the eighth grade also brought up the topic regularly and although he respected my “no,” it felt as if sex was often on his mind. He had a traumatic childhood of his own in which we bonded over throughout the years. The first years, he called constantly and we stayed up many nights talking until early mornings. At school, he caught me between classes, adoring little things about me, like the way I wore my hair, always delighted to see me. I loved him and the attention he gave me, but especially adored our connection--one that I didn’t realize at the time was rooted in trauma and codependency.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Being less than two years apart in age, Abe and I had some mutual friend groups and he proudly wore the “protective big brother” title. One day, he picked me up from school and on the drive, we slid off an iced road straight into a snowbank. It happened so slowly that there was no time time for fear, just thankful that it wasn’t worse.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Get out and push from the front while I hit the gas pedal to get us unstuck. Here, you push like this when you hear the engine revving. Got it?” He was kind in adolescence and took the time to teach me things, such as this.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Yet the moment I started dating Corbin, my brothers, particularly Abe, verbalized disapproval. His tone was lighthearted, but the words were foul. “So what, you’re a nigger-lover now?” He shook his head in disbelief, sighed, and giggled.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! No! Corbin isn’t like that.” During our childhoods, Dad trained us thoroughly on his stance of other races. Black and brown people were “rapists,” “lowlifes,” “thugs,” or “terrorists”. I knew that these perceptions were where Abe’s mind was, but had never met someone with another skin color who fit the criteria Dad spoke of. Especially not Corbin. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“He’s great! You just have to get to know him.” I tried remaining hopeful but doubted this explanation made any difference. It was all so confusing and didn’t make sense why my brother rejected someone so special to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know how else he expects people to look at him with cornrows, baggy clothes, and sagging pants. He’s a thug,” he grumbled back. I loathed Abe for this and wanted to defend Corbin. Yet I trusted my brother and this perception created insecurity when in Corbin’s presence, as if I didn’t notice something bad about him that the rest of the world saw.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re grandma and dad are racist," Mom always said. “It is because your dad grew up in Benton Harbor surrounded by black people and they weren’t very nice to him. It sounds like he got beat up a lot,” Dad shared similar stories, also using the word “nigger.” At the time, I barely knew the meaning—just that it was really bad. The conflict between these two worlds of my family versus what I felt in my core to be right was paralyzing. It was yet another experience where that created doubt on whether I could trust myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As Corbin and I’s relationship continued, he had a lot to process with his own trauma. Although honored that to have his trust, I eventually came to feel like a therapist. So much so that he even called me his therapist. It was a compliment, aside from needing someone to meet my emotional needs to the same depth I met theirs. He had poor boundaries with other girls, which made me uncomfortable. The more he dismissed my feelings of his interactions with others, the more distant we became. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Have I ever done anything to show that you shouldn’t trust me? Have I ever lied to you?” He sounded annoyed and irritated at signs of my vulnerability, leaving knots in my stomach. His responses felt similar to Mom’s treatment of me, leaving little space for any emotion that didn’t revolve around him. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, no, but the way you interact with those girls makes me uncomfortable…” I didn’t yet know the words for, “You dismiss my feelings repeatedly. That shows that I can’t trust you.” The conversations ended when I caved, abandoning myself by believing that he was right and I just needed more confidence.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Between these relationship dynamics and my family’s beliefs, we separated emotionally. Yet, he continued pursuing me for years. Thinking back, he was a young boy who had experienced the unthinkable and found a girl who listened intently, loving him anyway. Knowing the complexity of attachment issues that I do now, I imagine that breaking his connection to me was hard, if not nearly impossible for him. Everyone, even random parents and teachers believed we were a match made in heaven, two personalities meant to find each other. Two kids from broken homes persevering through adolescence together. Still, no one understood us. Even when he did attempt supporting me emotionally, I hadn’t known how to let him. The fact that I still didn’t desire sex with him made this lack of connection all the more prevalent.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At some point during high school, Corbin moved in with my boss, Jenn, and best friend, Cassie, who happened to be her daughter. He was best friends with Jenn’s Son, which sheds light into the small community of West Haven.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One day, in early spring of our junior year, Corbin and I continue a routine of hanging out after school. I have been on birth control for a while, hoping to ease nerves, yet still avoid sex. “Okay, let's do something else now. Like get ice cream and drive to the beach," I will say, finding any reason to get away from it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He is so used to this routine that one cool spring day when I don’t pull away, he pauses, appearing confused. “Should I keep going?” he asks, one eyebrow raised.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Observing his dark smooth skin, I run my hands along his muscles. He is the fastest track runner in Michigan for our school district and does well on the football team. My hands reach his six pack and while he stares with gentle brown eyes, waiting from my approval, all I can think, <i>Flawless. This man is flawless.</i> I pull him into a hug wishing to remain in the safety of each other's arms forever. He can’t reach me emotionally, but would never physically hurt me. He is a protector, choosing me over and over again. Never, in a million years, would he let someone lay a hand on me. He’s a man and I’m not afraid of him. <i>If I do not want sex with him, then I am truly broken,</i> I have convinced myself, yet refuse to become a victim to my own body. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, keep going, just keep going.” I state, unconvincingly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you sure you want this? Like, really sure?” He appears nervous, which is confusing because of the amount of people he has already had sex with during our times apart. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, just stop asking and keep going.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Finally, he accepts my words and continues. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Feeling this close to someone is overwhelming making it hard to breathe correctly. I feel trapped, yet push through the fear in hopes that getting this whole sex thing over with will “fix” me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A bit later, a knock sounds on the bedroom door. It is Jenn’s youngest daughter, Sam, who has just gotten off her school bus.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Corbin! Do you have any of that candy left?” she shouts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he pauses to answer, my eyes catch the clock beside the bed giving the perfect excuse. “Uhm, I have to go to work. I need to go.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Hold on, just a little longer. I’ll tell Sam to come back later.” He is determined to make sure I feel comfortable but doesn’t know that no matter his efforts, it is impossible. My body won’t let me feel safe with that level of intimacy.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Corbin, I have to go. I’m sorry, but I can’t be late for work. Really, I have to go!” I feel frantic.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My thoughts spiral on the drive to work. I feel as I’ve misled him for starting and not letting him finish. My brothers have said I dress as a “tease” with my jeans and makeup and this would confirm their accusations. Having sovereignty over my body wasn’t a notion that my family instilled in me. Instead, they viewed such acts as “mean,” “sinful,” or “insensitive”. At the age of seventeen, I hadn’t even known the word “boundaries” outside of athletics. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At work, one thought remains: <i>Sex feels familiar. Why?</i> The next year, in a psychology course, I would learn about how our minds can repress memories to protect us from the intensity of emotional trauma. Sometimes a flashback, nightmare, or body memory can resurface what’s buried and in this case, it was triggered by the sexual encounter. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A few days later, while driving Shannon home, a panic attack begins and I’m suddenly sobbing, unable to breathe. It is the same heaving feeling that came after a childhood whooping from Dad’s leather belt.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;From the passenger seat, Shannon looks terrified “Are you okay?! What’s happening?!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I just… It’s just…!” I can’t make words form between heaving breaths and tears.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Woah! I have never seen someone be this high on weed and cry this hard.” She is trying to make a joke but it isn’t what I needed. It’s as if years of heavy weed-smoking has sucked up any amount of joy my brain is capable of creating. There are no more ingredients for the “happy recipe” in my head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I cry harder, “I know. I don’t know what’s wrong. I’m so sorry, something’s wrong with me.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm… Okay… maybe… Kelly… maybe you should pull over," she instructs, “I don’t think it’s safe to be driving right now.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When we stop, I struggle to regain control, knowing that the emotions have to pass on their own.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once calm, I want to provide a reason for my emotions, but don’t know where they came from, aside from unprompted memories flashing through my brain. “I think that I was sexually abused by my brother, Josiah.” It doesn’t fully make sense why I say this, as the fear of anyone finding out remains. Yet some part of my body is screaming <i>sex feels familiar because</i>… And I can’t fight it down anymore, <i>you were sexually abused.</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After a deafening silence, she speaks. “Oh... I feel like I should share something personal about myself but the worst thing that has happened to me was drinking pee out of a mountain dew bottle on a family road trip as a kid.” She appears nervous, as if wanting to say just the right thing but not knowing what, so she goes for shared vulnerability. Her effort it appreciated, yet it’s still not what I need because drinking pee feels meaningless in comparison.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Even so, we laugh about her drinking pee and the stress of the situation starts passing. Putting the car into drive, we move on as if nothing happened.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For the following months, we never speak of my sexual abuse. The remainder of that summer is spent partying, working, trying to enjoy sex with Corbin and eventually other men. I bury the memories deep, hoping to  ignore them until they no longer existed at all.

									<h2><i>Elizabeth</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;As summer 2011 neared an end, I became even closer to my boss, Jenn. Throughout my two years working at the restaurant she had become like a mother to me with her love and acceptance. She never appeared annoyed by my talking or responded with unkind remarks. Instead, the more we spoke, the more she enjoyed my presence, making her more trustworthy than most in my life. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One day, while clearing a table, I lose myself in conversation with Jenn. “I think I might have been sexually abused by my brother Josiah.” Suddenly, my head feels dizzy just speaking the words. After years of burying the secret I’m now blabbering on about it for the second time.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She looks up from her work, pushed the metal framed glasses up the bridge of her nose. “Oh, really?” then continues clearing dishes beside me. Other than the brief pause, her demeanor doesn’t change. She works just as quickly, her long blond ponytail swinging as we head toward the kitchen. “Have you thought about… I don’t know… talking to someone about that?” she asks. Similar to Shannon, I can tell that she wants to say just the right thing without fully knowing how.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Talk to someone… like who?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Someone… I don’t know... like a therapist. You know? To help you sort it out.” Her voice perks up with the idea suggested.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The confidence she portrays is comforting. “A therapist? Yes! That is such a good idea! I don’t know why I never thought of that! I’m going to ask my mom to help me find a therapist! Thank you!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Something about this plan feels right, although I’m not fully certain why. Over the months I ask Mom multiple times to help me find a counselor. “Why do you want a counselor?” Mom usually squints in confusion, as if the idea is absurd.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Because Mom, something’s not right with me and I think talking to someone could really help," I explain, attempting to convince her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she doesn’t follow through, I plead. “Please Mom, you said you were going to help me!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I know Kelly, you’re right. I will! I just haven’t gotten around to it yet. But I’ll put it on my to-do list,” This has been her response following each conversation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Irritated from the lack of concern, I snatch my Medicaid insurance card from her purse and begin a google search. Over the next few days I call multiple places, many of them at least thirty miles outside of West Haven, but none of them accept our government-run insurance. The potential referrals they give circle me back to places I have already called and as my hope was dwindles, risk-taking behaviors increase. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On a mid October day I drive a car full of intoxicated friends around town while blaring music. It’s not even 2pm yet but the fun has started early for our senior year homecoming, “Oh my gosh guys, look at me! I’m smoking a bowl, with a drink and cigarette in hand, while driving. Talk about multitasking!” We all laugh and Shannon comments on how proud she is.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For years my friends have called me “Monica.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You are the anxious mom of the group. The one who takes care of us. Monica is a name that fits you well!” They decided it one night after I changed Shannon out of vomit-soaked clothes and yelled at her for taking pills that I had commanded her not to.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During this car drive, they see me take off my “Monica” hat and loosen up. There is no longer a “mom” or “uptight” person keeping us in line. Just us, without a care in the world.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;No one notices the dangers of me not caring, yet I am struggling. Giving up hope, wishing for pain and loneliness to end. Getting high while driving this day is not a mindless teenage mistake. Instead, as I speed down a country road, seeing how fast Dad’s little black car goes, a thought repeats in my head: <i>So what if I die? If I’m never going to be good enough, why try?</i> It is a well thought-out plan to intentionally flirt with death.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When we arrive at the school pep assembly, Shannon is ill from alcohol intoxication and requests to wait in the car. The assembly will be quick, then I can drive her home. Inside the school, students cheer as the fight song blares from speakers, everyone screaming our lungs out while feeling the noise of the crowd rumbling through our chests.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly in, the vice principal approaches me in the bleachers. “Kelly?” In a school of around 500 students, he doesn’t know me so a teacher must have pointed me out. “I need you to come with me," he instructs, directing me toward his office. My mouth goes dry knowing what this must be about. The worst trouble I have gotten into at school was an occasional ‘tardy infraction’ after talking too long with friends in the hallway but never have I been called to the principal's office.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Did you drive Shannon Burke to school this morning?” He stands accusingly with hands on his hips.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My experience has conditioned me to fear anyone in power, especially men. We are alone now and his deep voice shoots shivers down my spine. His massive stature reminds me of the Hulk peering down and if he wanted, he could probably pick me up and squish me. My body is fragile against such power. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Despite what my family thinks of me, I never lie. In fact, I pride myself on telling the truth, hoping they will eventually see my authenticity. Just the year prior, a party was busted and everyone denied drinking when the cops asked, except for me, knowing that in my household, nothing compared to the whooping that came from a lie. To my relief, I got out of that charge, something about the cops being too rough and mishandling us teenagers. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;If I tell the truth there’s a chance he might yell at or punish me while alone. Bending the truth might help me get away with this and no one will have to know. No harm done. Besides I didn’t drive Shannon to school, as my car is parked on another street so saying “no” isn’t a full lie, I reason.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I didn’t drive her to school this morning,” I answer cautiously.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, that’s weird, because she was found passed out outside your car and she is currently sitting in the back of a police car. She’s pretty drunk.” He pauses and steps closer, as if rubbing his power in my face. Or maybe this is just how it feels amidst my fear. “So I’m going to ask you one more time, no more lying. Did you drive Shannon to school today?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Caught in my lie, I answer. “Ya… I guess I drove her to the pep assembly.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I have a desperate urge to plead with him. “Please, I’ll do anything just don’t let me get into trouble. You have no idea what my dad will do if he finds out! He will hurt me! He will hurt me worse than ever before for getting in trouble with the cops and at school! I’m terrified of him and I’ll never drink again if you just please just don’t let my dad find out.” Instead, I physically bite my tongue and tense my muscles too numb the emotion. I don’t throw pity parties, those are childish and and it wouldn’t make a difference anyway.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Luckily, the cops find no drugs in the vehicle, just unopened alcohol. This lands me with court fees and three months of probation, which require taking courses on the negative implications of alcohol. Once completed, it will be removed from my record upon my eighteenth birthday. Mom blames Shannon for negatively influencing my life, even contacting her dad to yell at him. My own Dad, to my relief, never mentions the minor in possession charges to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After this incident, my mood tanked even more. My probation officer was one assigned to local youths and could often be found socializing with my peers at the high school. He had informed me that I could be drug tested at any time but that he wouldn’t test if there wasn’t a reason to. Weed and cigarette smoking continued as much as before, but only in the safety of certain friends' homes. Shannon and I were finished being friends, as the lifestyle we engaged in made me feel worse. After years of trying to help her as she sped down a road of reckless behavior and drugs I was now keenly aware of myself being pulled down a similar path. Taking risks with substances and longing for death wasn’t like me, which meant breaking things off with her to save myself.

										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By senior year my grades had slightly improved and I was “dual-enrolled” in a few courses at the local community college. All of my friends were attending, so naturally, I joined to stay near them. The college, being built just eight years before was much nicer and clean than the high school, which had mold, mice, and ceiling leaks. My favorite course was Introduction to Psychology, taught by an adjunct professor, Elizabeth Harris. Her personality was gentle and down to earth; I could tell she genuinely valued and understood her students by the way she interacted with them. She sometimes spoke of her husband and three children during examples, and it seemed she lived a life I only dreamed of. As a young girl hours were spent on my scooter imagining the woman I would someday be. Eventually, this created a coping method: each time meeting someone, I searched for endearing and strong personality traits and applied them to myself. As she introduced herself to the class, it seemed she was a good person who held many respectable qualities.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During attendance on the first day of class professor Harris reaches my name and pauses. “Kelly Cole… I know that name. Do you have a brother?” she asks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I do!” In this small town, it’s not uncommon for nearly everyone to know at least someone in my family. Even people who I don’t know have approached me with comments such as “Hey look! It’s little Cole!” And I'm used to the routine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Let’s see, there’s Abe?” I figure that he is closest to my age, making it a more likely connection.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Nope, that doesn’t sound right.” She smiles and shakes her head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, well then there’s Chase? Or Josiah? Or Daniel?” The class laughs, knowing that naming my entire family might take awhile.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, he was uh… well he would have attended a specific Christian school many years ago. It’s probably not the same connection.” It is the right connection, just one I never  wouldn’t have expected. My two eldest brothers attended a Christian school during their elementary years, prior to Mom pulling them out for homeschooling. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh! That would be Jacob or James!” I exclaim.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“James! Ah yes, that’s who it is! We were in class together for a short time! It was a long time ago so I don’t remember him much.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Already, with this small interaction, I feel connected to her. Not many people know of the small Christian school located in the middle of nowhere a few towns over and here is someone from that isolated world, thriving as a therapist and college instructor. She must know both worlds.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Professor Harris’s lectures included many topics such as emotions, motivation, personalities, abnormal behaviors, and psychodynamics. In the past, I struggled with school, but this foray into psychology made sense, making it possible to connect with the learning material in a new way. Even textbook readings made sense, always leaving me wanting to know more.

										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By November, I needed a new avenue for support, as Shannon now bullied me for abandoning our friendship. This was not unlike her, there were many past incidences of her kicking dents in my car, breaking my belongings, and starting nasty rumors around school. Now, her technique was following me through the halls repeating “bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch” like a broken record. Or texting me about how fat I looked at school. Once she even made a Facebook status wishing me dead.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The worst was when a text message from her read:“Just wait until everyone at school finds out about what happened to you when you were a kid. Ooo family secrets are dark.” Her threats were to be taken seriously. I recall that once she burned the image of her sister's face from a collection of family pictures following an argument. Another time, she taunted a young girl about an abortion she had until the girl fought her. Shannon was sure to tell the school how “psychotic” and “crazy” that girl was for punching her “without reason.” She played dirty, I knew that, but would she really be this nasty?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Not knowing what to do, my thoughts race: <i>If anyone at school finds out about the abuse, I will kill myself.</i> No matter how many cigarettes or how much weed I smoke, the nervous jitters won’t stop. I can’t control Shannon and know she’s capable of spreading information like wildfire, if she hasn't already. One day in late November I sit in my psychology class with a plan; Since mom and google have proved unreliable in finding me a counselor, things would be taken into my own hands.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My legs shake anticipating a conversation I’m planning with Professor Harris after class. She’s a rockstar and it feels like preparing myself to speak with a famous role model, only they don’t know they are famous or a role model. It’s much more scary asking about something as vulnerable as therapy, yet she feels like the best option for knowing someone.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After class, I wait in the back of a line of people asking about assignments. No one else can be in the room when I ask this question; it’s too big. Finally, the line ends and we are alone.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Hey, what’s up? You have a question about the assignment?” She smiles.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, uh, not the assignment. I was uhm… actually… uh, hoping you could help me with something else. I was hoping you could help me find a counselor,” I explain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, ya, of course! I know a few people. But first it depends on what you’re looking for.” She shifts to face me, showing her full investment in this conversation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, what do you mean? I’m just looking for someone to talk to I guess.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, someone to talk to about what? It will help me know who will be a good fit.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I shift my feet and look down, wondering whether it is appropriate to tell her. Finally I state “Well, I think that I was sexually abused by my brother.” Her eyes remain on me but it’s difficult to meet them. The feelings of wanting to disappear are too strong.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She softens even more. “Oh gosh, Kelly, thank you for sharing this with me. When did this happen?” I feel her empathy and genuine concern.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know. I guess always. I mean, all of the time since I can remember.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Does anyone else know?” she probes.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth knows Shannon, as we have her class together. “Just Shannon and I told my boss Jenn at the restaurant and she said maybe I should get a therapist. I asked my mom to help me find one but she’s so annoying and not helping and I can’t find anyone who accepts my Medicaid insurance. But Shannon said she was going to tell the school so now I really need to talk to someone before that happens.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Where is he now? Is it still happening?” she asks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I mean no because I live with my grandma and he lives with my mom and little siblings. And the last time he tried I didn’t let him. I just need someone to talk to because I think it might be why I’m struggling. And when Shannon tells everyone at school I’m not going to be okay.” I feel frustrated that Elizabeth is invested in the abuse part, rather than the fact all of my peers might gain the information. The abuse memories were difficult, but nothing compared to the idea of people finding out against my will.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re so strong and brave for sharing this with me.” She pauses. “Here, I’m going to give you the number to a therapist. She is good. Really good. I would trust her with the people I am closest with, but it’s in Stevensville which is about a thirty minute drive. Are you able to go that far?” She squints, as if preparing for me to say “no”.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Stevensville? That's perfect. It’s where my Mom lives!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh! Okay, I’ll let her know that I’m sending a referral her way. But Kelly,” her tone turns serious. “I need you to know that this is not your fault. Okay? It’s not. You did the right thing by talking to me. I do want you to know that I am going to have to report this to CPS.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Now I pause, uncertain how to answer. I hadn’t thought about the possibility of child protective services. <i>What if my siblings get taken away?</i>  Dad had previously spoke of child protective services being the government coming to snatch kids away from their parents.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No! No! Please! You can’t! You can’t report this! I am okay and he’s not hurting me now. If I talk to a counselor, I will be fine. Really! Just please don’t call because my family is going to be so angry. They are going to hate me. And what if my siblings get taken away? Please! You can’t call.” I plead, desperate for her to understand.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m sorry Kelly, but by law, I have to. You’re a minor and he is still living with other kids. That puts them at risk of being abused too," she explains.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Although I don’t dare say it, there are memories of Josiah sexually abusing my younger sister, Sarah, and others over the years. She is right, but I now need to convince my family.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After class, I drive straight to Mom’s. “Where’s Josiah?” I ask upon arriving at the duplex.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“He’s not here right now, why?” Mom responds.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, I need to talk to you privately. It’s important.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh no, what happened?” Her jaw drops, showing that she is ready for some drama.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Nothing...just...let’s go talk in your room.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she finally meets me in her bedroom, I sit beside her on the bed, preparing to comfort her. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So you know how I have been asking you to help me find a counselor? Well, it was because I was sexually abused by Josiah and I was looking for someone to talk to. Then Shannon said she was going to tell people at school so I went to my teacher because I knew she would help me find a counselor but when I told her she said she needs to report it to CPS.” I hope that sharing more details will allow her to understand better and need her to know that no one is intentionally getting anyone into trouble.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I long for the words heard earlier from Elizabeth. “You are so strong and so brave. Thank you for sharing this with me. This is not your fault.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Instead, Mom’s eyes are big and stuck on the floor in front of her. “Oh… did... she report it already?” she finds words.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I don’t think so. But Mom,” I pause to calm my panic. “I wanted to talk to you because I don’t want you to be mad at me. I didn’t know she was going to call CPS. I didn’t even think about it and feel so stupid.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her voice is heavy, slow, and sad. She meets my eyes, then they fall away. “No, Kelly, I’m not mad. It was stupid. I wish you hadn’t done that but no, I’m not mad at you for something you didn’t know.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Feeling relieved that Mom isn’t mad, I finish the conversation and leave quickly to avoid any potential run-ins with Josiah.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;That night I receive a call. “Hello?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Hey Kelly, it’s Elizabeth. I just called it in and want to check to see how you are doing? I do not know if they will do anything with it, but I know you were feeling worried.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I think I’m doing okay. I talked to my mom and she said that she’s not mad at me and that’s what I was worried about," I explain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, that’s good. Where are you staying tonight? Do you have a safe place to go?” she asks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I’m staying at my friend Jami’s.” Jami is a good friend from the soccer team. A kind soul and not someone who I typically party with. Her friendship feels healthy and safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, good. How are you feeling? What are some thoughts you’re having?” This is the first time it feels like someone truly cares about how I’m doing.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Elizabeth, is he going to go to jail? Are my siblings and I going to get taken away?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know, Kelly. I am not an investigator and I cannot answer that.” We process a bit longer before ending. “Please reach out if you need anything and call that number I gave you to schedule a counseling session," she instructs.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, I will.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Within five minutes, I arrive at Jami’s and update her on my day. “Oh my gosh Kelly, that’s so scary! You are so amazing. And so strong. If you need to stay here longer than a night or need a place to live I’m sure my mom won’t mind," she offers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Thanks, I just… I don’t know… I don’t know what to expect.” I pace her basement, unable to sit still or catch any of my thoughts. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Moments later, Mom calls “Kelly, the police are here and they are arresting Josiah. Okay Kelly? They handcuffed him and are arresting him right now. He’s being arrested. I thought you should know that.” Her voice is accusatory and I feel her anger.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? Seriously?!” I can’t muster any other words. Many years later, I learned that when children’s protective services and the police arrived, Sarah disclosed her own sexual abuse during their questioning. She has since told me that Mom instructed her to lie so although enough detail was disclosed for a direct arrest, very little was shared concerning the extent of the actual abuse.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“And they want me to ask you when they can talk to you tomorrow.” Mom says through the phone.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, tell them that I can’t talk tomorrow. I go straight from school to work so I can’t talk to them.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom hangs up and a short while later another call comes from a detective to schedule an interview at the police station.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Texts are also pouring in from Mom saying things like:
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You are so selfish. You know that Kelly? You need to learn to stop being so bitter and forgive.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You have no idea what you’re putting me and this family through.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“God will punish you for sending your brother to jail out of anger. You are a bitter person Kelly.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You are tearing this entire family apart. I hope you know that.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The texts continue one after another for hours into the night, just as similar messages from her will come for days, months, and even years following.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I try defending myself with responses like: “But Mom, you promised you wouldn’t be mad at me. I’m really sorry.  I didn’t mean to get anyone in trouble,” all to no avail. Eventually I convince myself that she will understand once the emotion from it all passes. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I ramble while reading the messages to my friend. “What?! What is wrong with your mom! Kelly, this is not your fault!! I can’t believe she is saying stuff like that!” Jami looks ready to fight. I feel validated in her response and thankful to have someone understanding my perspective. I am not alone. She is a friend who will remain in my life through adulthood, sending me “thinking of you gifts” and encouraging notes for many years.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;There’s a feeling of desperation to scream, or maybe even destroy Jami’s basement, but smashing glass bottles on her parents’ minibar or throwing wall decorations through the window could just barely touch the amount of tension in my body. Instead, I shove those urges aside and message Elizabeth the updates. Again, she responds with the same compassion as in the classroom, saying things like, “Oh Kelly, I am so sorry that you are going through this. Please remember that this is not your fault. You are brave and strong and have done absolutely nothing wrong.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Repeating her words in my head, I hold the phone close, as if it makes them more true, and attempt to sleep. Each time I come remotely close to rest, my body jerks awake shaking uncontrollably. I have spoken about the abuse and now there is no turning back. Life itself will be forever changed.

									<h2><i>Interrogations</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is a cool November day and the sun beams through clouds as I park my dad’s beat-up Prizm in the community college lot. Elizabeth is planning to drive me to the police station where I will give my statement regarding the sexual abuse. Feeling relieved that she hasn’t arrive yet, I smoke another cigarette.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>What am I doing?</i> I ask myself, struggling to understand my situation. I had thought that talking to a counselor would help me, but is it worth the risk? Do I actually want Josiah to go to prison?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>My answer is No, of course I do not want Josiah to get into trouble.</i> My sole focus has been trying to help myself and there hasn’t been thought about how that might mean hurting Josiah, Mom, my siblings, and many others.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is difficult to describe the experience of living a chaotic life of regular abuse and neglect, then realizing that the trauma has finally caught up to my mind, body, and spirit, only to have everything blow up when asking for help. At the age of seventeen, I do not know what it is like to identify or have my needs met. Instead, it feels that everyone belongs to this world but me and my sole reason for existing is to appease and please others. If done well enough, I might be given affection, but showing any of my own humanness puts me at risk of being a burden, rejected, or forgotten. Not receiving the love and nurturing that I needed most over the years has made me invisible--even to myself. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The personal need of a counselor is evident only because death sounds more pleasant than life, which feels like a bigger issue. I now wonder if saving myself is worth the cost of hurting the people who I love the most. I want it to be, but the answer is no, so I inhale more smoke, desperate for relief.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth arrives in a small black car rather than the light blue minivan that she usually drives. I lather myself in lotion and spray scents onto my coat to hide the smell of smoke.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sorry I’m late, I had to switch vehicles with my husband so that he could get the kids from school," she explains quickly, as if coming from a busy day. Then, she appears relieved having made it to me in time.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly into the drive, I stiffen and regret allowing someone to attend the questioning with me. Being alone feels safer. Outside, vibrant colored trees blur past, leaving me distant from the world as I wonder what to expect. <i>What will the officers look like? What types of questions will they ask? Should I answer them? Should I lie like my mom has instructed? Could I answer them even if I tried? Will I have any words at all?</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So, how are you feeling?” Elizabeth interrupts my thoughts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I tune in briefly and see her black sunglasses resting on small ears where pearl earrings dangle lightly. It’s relieving that eye contact isn’t required during a drive. “I’m feeling okay.” My eyes return to the side window, mind disappearing into leftover thoughts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After quick glance in my direction and back to the road, she probes on, “Your legs are shaking. What are some thoughts that you are having?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Suddenly I can’t remember the last time my limbs weren’t shaking. Even my bones ache from the strain. Tensing tighter, I channel the tremors back to my core where they can’t be seen. “I just don’t want to get Josiah into trouble and I don’t want my family to be mad at me.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This time, Elizabeth stiffens. “Kelly, look at me.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Peering over, I focus on anything but her eyes.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I need you to really look at me and hear this.” A glance at the road and back to me, she pulls her sunglasses down. Looking into her eyes burns, as if she sees pieces of me that I don’t dare speak. The vulnerability is too much.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She waits, silently, until my gaze meets hers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“This is not your fault. You have done nothing wrong. Nothing.” She pauses for another peek at the road. “Do not listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. This is not your fault. Okay?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay.” My voice lacks confidence, barely over a whisper. Pushing the sunglasses back into place, her focus returns to the drive.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t believe a word she said and it is too early to know that the drive down this winding road will be the start of a soul binding friendship. My life's greatest gift.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is late afternoon when we arrive at the police station. Peering into the rearview mirror, there’s a store: Family Video. On weekends when I visit Mom it is where we rent movies and buy snacks for sleepovers with my friends. I had never noticed the police station across the parking lot or thought I would arrive here for disclosure statement. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you ready? Is there anything else that you want to talk about first?” Elizabeth’s face shows sincerity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t think so.” I take a deep breath, anxious to get this over with.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once inside, the receptionist greets us. “Hi, can I help you?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth turns, waiting for me to answer but I’ve lost the words.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“She has an appointment to talk with an officer," she explains.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once checked in, we are instructed to sit in two chairs located by the door. The waiting room is small and uninspired. It reminds me of the jail where Mom often visited Glen when I was young. At the trailer, we were to ask an adult before answering his collect calls from jail. Mom usually accepted them, explaining she felt bad for him and that God was calling her to minister. The plastic waiting room chairs felt much bigger as a little girl. Her visits with Glen lasted awhile and it felt uncomfortable when the police officers stared at me from their check-in desk, as if I shouldn’t be there. After voicing these concerns to Mom, she had let me wait in the van. I didn’t mind going to the jail and even begged to join in efforts to stay near her. Even when she was inside, knowing her presence was close brought comfort.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Waiting next to Elizabeth, I look down, fixating on my favorite ripped skinny jeans. <i>I hope the holes don’t make me look bad,</i> I think to myself. Then, seeing my fake brown leather purse, there’s internal panic. <i>Oh no! What if my purse smells like weed? Or what if I left weed in my purse and the officer finds it!</i> My thoughts spiral and anxiety grows.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly?” An officer approaches from behind a door, looking like every white, middle-aged police officer I remember from Southwest Michigan: round belly, white hair, honeyed smile.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I stand, but Elizabeth remains seated. I looked to her with eyes screaming “don’t leave me alone with this man."
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Did you both want to come back?” The officer notices our cues.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Can she come, please?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, absolutely.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I turn to Elizabeth, “Is that okay?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, of course, if you want me too.” She is already grabbing her purse to stand.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The room we are led to is even tinier than the lobby. All white walls with a square table and too many chairs crammed into the small space. Or maybe my suffocating anxiety made the room feel smaller. The officer sits across from me, and it appears Elizabeth has chosen her seat intentionally between me and the officer with a posture that claims protection.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So I have some questions about the report. I just need to take your statement. You see that mirror over there?” He smiles and a set of uneven, coffee stained teeth appear under his mustache.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth sits up straighter and attempts to assess how I might be feeling, then offers a half smile and encouraging nod that I imagine says, <i>you’ve got this.</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I make eye contact with the officer and give my own half smile with a nod.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The questions are straight forward, quick and exploring for detail. I answer to the best of my ability.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What type of sexual abuse?” He begins.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm…” I look to Elizabeth for reassurance and she nods. “I guess… uhm… like... fingering and hand jobs. And he would… lick me down there and have me give him head.” I have lost the words for oral sex and feel humiliated by how ridiculous this answer must sound. My face burns. “And he would have me use my parents’ vibrator.” My head turns around toward the door and I feel an urge to sprint from the room. A desire to disappear completely.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What did the vibrator look like?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?” My head is fuzzy, struggling to understand words.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Like, what did it look like? The shape? The color?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I describe it to the best of my ability, then retract my head back toward the door, desperate to get out of the room. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know what I want to do?” A look of revulsion forms on his face as he holds his pen up, “I want to take this pen and jam it into Josiah's eye.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth and I look at each other uncomfortably as an awkward silence fills the air.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh," I finally muster a word.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Did he penetrate you?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?” I look to Elizabeth, confused.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, he’s asking if he put anything inside of you," she explains.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm… Kind of… I-I don’t know.” It’s so hard to focus.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“How did he make you give him head?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I-I don’t know how he made me.” After looking back and forth between he and Elizabeth I provide some sort of answer that hopefully makes sense.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It feels like an interrogation and I worry about answering incorrectly. <i>Am I in trouble? Is Josiah in trouble? Are we both in trouble?</i> For many years following I will wonder why victims are made to feel like the perpetrator during interrogations after disclosing abuse. I will also wonder how people develop a concept that the abused is responsible for destroying the perpetrators life when they go to prison, rather than understanding that Josiah made his own path the moment he chose to put his hands on me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“How old were you when this happened?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, I don’t know. It has happened ever since I can remember.” Suddenly, I worry that not having specific dates might discredit me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Did it continue happening after the age of twelve?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I think of the specific locations where the abuse happened. We lived in Concord from when I was eleven to fourteen years old. After that, Mom married George and moved to the Stevensville house.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, it happened after the age of twelve.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“When was the last time you remember it happening?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I know the last time, but don’t have exact dates. We were staying at my brother James and his wife Monica’s house in the city, about an hours drive away, for Josiah's twenty-first birthday celebration. They went to the bars with friends while I babysat my niece and returned hours later, giddy and drunk from a fun night. A movie, <i>The Hangover,</i> was turned on while everyone settled down and shortly in, I fell fast asleep on the living room couch.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In the night, someone shakes me awake. It's Josiah.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly,” he whispers. “Come here. Let’s go into the other room.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The living room is crowded with friends and older siblings who had also fallen asleep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Josiah, leave me alone!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;His hushed voice continues. “Common Kelly, I know you want to. Just real quick, I promise.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Irritated, I sit up, not knowing how to proceed. Yet somehow, I feel powerful knowing that no matter what happens this night, he will not be getting what he wants. I head for the bathroom to buy myself time to think. When finished, Josiah stands just outside the door. His pants are undone and he is already touching himself. Eyes focused on the couch, I push passed him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, wait.” He grasps my hand, pulling me back toward him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Josiah! I said I don’t want to!” My heart is pounding.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“C’mon, Kelly. Please.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Finally, my voice rises. “Josiah, I said stop!” I meet his eyes, determined for him see my rage, daring him to see my power.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Knowing that my next words would be a scream to wake the others, he releases his hand from mine. Satisfied, I rush back to the couch to hide under the blanket. He follows, continuing to pester, but I pretend to sleep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I am not a little girl anymore.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Back in the police station, I continue reflecting on this memory. Josiah's twenty-first birthday, drinking, babysitting my niece, and the hangover movie.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“The last time he tried, I was fifteen years old.” I’m certain as I explain the memory.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“But when was the last time he actually touched you?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know.” I think of the Stevensville house.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is a fall day during my freshman year of high school and I’m still fourteen years old. Mom has left to run errands and pick my siblings up from their Lutheran school. I’m deep into homework at the dining room table when Josiah enters from his basement bedroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He has <i>the look.</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly,” his voice is soft. “Come here. Come down in the basement with me.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Before he speaks, I know what his facial expression means and groan in annoyance. “No Josiah, I’m doing homework.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“C’mon, Kelly, I know you want to.” He inches toward me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah, stop. I said I don’t want to.” My muscles are tight with irritation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“C’mon, Kelly, please. I promise it will be good.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My eyes don’t leave the textbook and I continue writing without response. When he doesn’t leave, I glance over. His pants are undone and he is touching himself. “C’mon, Kelly, please.” He forms a soft smile, hoping this might persuade me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah!” I surprise even myself by shouting and stare directly at him. “If you do not leave me alone, I am going to tell Mom.” Our eyes fight.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I know my point has been heard, I return to homework and he shuffles back to the basement, alone. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I mean he tried to touch me at the Stevensville house, but I didn’t let him.” I tell the officer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, do you remember the last time he actually touched you?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I guess it would be the Concord house, when I was twelve or thirteen.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Detailed questions continue for what feels like an endless amount of time.
										<br>
										</p>
										~
										<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;The sun is starting to set by the time we leave the police station.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, that guy was not someone who should have been interviewing you for this. I don’t know what they were thinking putting you in a room to be questioned by him.” Elizabeth states the moment we are in the car.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Really?” I feel comfort knowing that she disliked the man as much as I did. “Why?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I just couldn’t believe some of the things that he said and questions he asked. He seemed very uneducated about these topics.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, me either.” I don’t have anything to compare the interview to, but if Elizabeth says the interviewer was bad, it must be true. I’m beginning to trust her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Let’s stop for dinner to debrief. I think it will be good to get some food into your body. Do you like Panera?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is the time of year when darkness hits before dinner and the musky smell of fall leaves fills the air.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Do you need to smoke?” Elizabeth asks, staying in tune to what I might need in the moment.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The last thing I want to do is eat, but she insists that I try. I settle for chicken noodle soup, a comfort food that will hopefully go down easily. Shortly after sitting down, she takes a phone call from her husband. I listen, wondering what her family is like. She speaks of her kids often and I imagine her living the white picket fence life. Raising her children with love, structure, and routine while head over heels in love with her husband. A safe life where everyone's needs are met. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sorry, that was my husband. He was asking if I am going to make it home for dinner.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, we can go if you need to get home. I can ask for a to-go container.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, it is really okay. He just was not sure if he should make something for the kids or not. He is okay making the kids dinner so we are allll gooood.” She gives an assuring smile. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I attempt to eat but my stomach remains in knots so instead, I pull my feet onto the chair and hug my knees closely for comfort.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You didn’t eat much of your soup," she observes.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I’m just not very hungry.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“How are you feeling? What are some thoughts that you're having?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know. I just really don’t want Josiah to get into trouble. And I don’t want my family to be mad at me.” I can’t come to terms with either of these concepts. <i>Sending someone else to prison?</i> I feel like the worst person in the world. <i>Potentially losing my mom?</i> More damage to that relationship feels unthinkable.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know Kelly, I have been thinking, and I just can’t wrap my mind around it. I cannot understand why your mom is treating you this way. I have three boys and keep thinking that what if I had a daughter and one of my sons did this to her. Or what if one of my sons did this to another. My sons are my life and I love them more than anything, but if any of them did this to one of my other kids I would want justice and for them to have whatever consequences came. Even if that meant visiting them in prison or rehab or wherever else. There are consequences to the choices that we make.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Elizabeth, you don’t understand. You think that right now, but if you were in this situation you would know that it’s not that easy. You can’t just choose between two of your kids.” These are my mom's words and I’m in complete denial of the fact that based on these responses, she has already chosen Josiah.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Maybe you’re right. Maybe it would be more difficult when it came down to it. Even if it were hard though, I know that part of loving my children is holding them accountable for their decisions, especially when they are this bad. If not, how would they ever learn? I would have a job to protect my other kids from farther harm even if it meant one of my kids having to learn the hard way. What he did to you was not okay. He hurt you. That is not your fault and he should not have done that. If one of my kids experienced this at the hands of one of my others, I would do whatever it took to protect that child and make sure the other got the help they needed, whatever that would look like.” Her eyes are honest and I want to believe her. She is desperate to reach me, working hard to help me see a different perspective. But she is just one person--who I barely know--standing against everyone else in my life speaking the opposite. She is challenging my entire world--a world in which the only righteous choice is to forgive and forget, even when men continually hurt people. A world in which parents feel bad for perpetrators because they must have had a hard life and female victims are told not to make a big deal of it. A world in which the truth will only set you free if you are talking about Christ’s salvation. But the truth of the sufferer should be concealed, hidden away, and allowed to fester as a wound forever.

									<h2><i>The Black Sheep</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;A week later I arrive at the Children’s Advocacy Center for another interview. The building is a small, house-like structure located in a town near Stevensville. Shortly after I arrive alone, Mom shows up with Sarah, Daniel, and Avalon. While standing in the lobby waiting, I hug my siblings tightly, hoping that this simple gesture will communicate: <i>I am so sorry for putting you in this position.</i> At the time part of me held responsibility for the abuse, particularly the heavy weight of everything following my disclosing, a burden that would follow for many years. The idea of being the “black sheep” in the family proved more true than ever, validating feelings I had experienced my entire life.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In the lobby, Mom approaches me and says something like: “You know Kelly, you don't have to talk. You don't have to say anything. Josiah could get into a lot of trouble if you do and we need to keep him out of jail.” Her comments send a flaming rage through my veins. Just like when I was a kid, my wellbeing means nothing in comparison to Josiah's. At this point, I am so desperate for the love of a parent, Mom could easily manipulate me by giving the slightest amount of love, empathy, support, or understanding. Yet I have received nothing but criticism, judgment, and demands to stay silent. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I give mom an uncomfortable eye roll and walk to the other end of the room. <i>Why isn't Mom being caring and supportive like Elizabeth is?</i> I wonder. <i>Why doesn’t she acknowledge that I have been hurt? Or that it was wrong? Why does she want me to keep this a secret? Especially considering her stance on lying being such a big sin?</i>  There are no answers for these questions. My family has put the weight of Josiah going to jail on my shoulders, yet everything feels so far out of my control, as it has my entire life.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;What I do know is that regardless of not wanting Josiah to go to jail, I won't survive keeping my secret any longer, for its heaviness would surely destroy me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, I am directed to a room down a hallway. This space is more welcoming than the police station reminding me of a church nursery with carpeted floors and soft colored wallpaper. I sit in a padded rocking chair beside a shelf of toys and across from me a woman rests in a rocking chair of her own. She introduces herself as some sort of social worker and for some reason her presence feels calming. On the wall beside her there’s a two sided mirror. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“There are detectives on the other side of that mirror and this questioning will be recorded," she explains. Today, I remember nothing more about this interview, except that despite my mom waiting in the lobby nearby, I answered all of this woman’s questions truthfully. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly after leaving, my phone floods with texts from Mom. Apparently, the workers at the center have informed her that Daniel and Avalon denied any abuse. Sarah disclosed some, but not much. But I, Kelly, disclosed a lot of detailed sexual abuse that went on nearly daily for many years, including after the age of twelve years old. This was a very important detail because as we will soon learn, it adds an additional legal charge. Thinking back, I imagine the workers informed mom of these details in hopes it would give her additional perspective into the truth of the matter, but can’t help wondering if they might have acted differently had they known how mom would use this against me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After the interview at the Children’s Advocacy Center mom’s texts continue and even get worse than they have been. “I told you not to talk. What did you tell them? Josiah is going to jail and it’s all your fault. You’re a bitter person Kelly and you need to learn to forgive. You are destroying this family and need serious help.” The messages come in paragraphs, one after another, after another, after another. My head hurts not knowing how to calm Mom or help her understand. At seventeen years old I don’t have the coping tools to deal with this legal and emotional situation, much less help an adult to understand the gravity of the abuse. Rather than consoling me, Mom repeatedly accuses me of being angry and vengeful. This is confusing because I feel no anger--just fear, pain and confusion. So much confusion.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Many years later, when Sarah, Avalon, and I reflect on these experiences, we all agree that at different points Mom told us to lie. Avalon states, "Mom told me to lie and I was terrified of her so I listened! I mean, Josiah never sexually abused me but I didn't tell them about the people who had!” Silence follows these conversations as we all internally reflect on the traumatizing experience of our mother telling us to lie about our abuse. There aren’t words to describe that heavy of a betrayal. “I will say though,” Avalon jumps back in “that the sexual abuse I was experiencing stopped after this. I think he got too scared after seeing what Josiah went through.” She would have been eleven years old at the time of my disclosing.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad contacts me a few days after the Children’s Advocacy Center interview. For some reason, I feel a small sense of relief when he asks to meet and talk. As a child he favored me over Josiah and I imagine he will be angry that someone laid hands on his little girl.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I arrive at his home, he directs me toward the garage. It is a snowless December, cold and cloudy. During this conversation I observe that Sylvia stands a few feet behind dad, as if hiding in his shadows. “So Kelly, I need to know exactly what is going on here.” Dad demands.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, I went to talk to my teacher because I was looking for a counselor and when I told her that I was sexually abused by Josiah she needed to report it…” I finish speaking without a stutter. Having repeated the same story for what feels like one hundred times just this week, I could tell it in my sleep. But more importantly, I feel confident in Dad’s security.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“When exactly did this happen?” His voice is stern.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t remember when it started. It just always happened, ever since I could remember," I explain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So you can’t tell me when exactly it happened?” His questions now feel accusing, as if to catch me in a lie.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know Dad. It happened regularly, all of the time.” I am desperate to convince him of my truth.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you sure you didn’t hallucinate it or make it up? You know, marijuana is a hallucinogen and you’ve been smoking that stuff. It can make you think all kinds of wonky stuff! You know your brother could get in all kinds of trouble for you just spewing words around like this, right?! That’s how serious this is!” His voice is rising and I feel shame as if he is speaking to me like a child. <i>Is he joking? I am living this out, of course I know how serious it is.</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Dad, I d-d-d-idn’t. I d-d-didn’t… h-h-halluci-ci-cinate this. It actually happened.” My stutter is returning and I can’t make it stop. The accusations of me hallucinating feel ridiculous. How could someone think that I imagined such an experience?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, I also think that you have been doing cocaine, which can also make you want to lie and make stuff up, so I’m sure that could be the case too," he explains.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?!” Now my voice is rising, defenses so high that the stutter disappears again. “Dad, I don’t do coke! I don’t even know what cocaine looks like aside from what I have seen in the movies! And marijuana doesn’t make someone hallucinate!” The marijuana one angers me, considering that I had once found Dad’s personal jar of it on a kitchen shelf. My eyes look to Sylvia, desperate for support. Instead, she refuses to make eye contact and remains silent.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, you do, Kelly! I saw it in your eyes myself. That day you came to move out, your pupils were all dilated and you were acting all energetic, and I’ve seen that before. It was cocaine you were on. I’m sure of it!” He’s shouting now.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Dad, it was Adderall that I took that day, which also doesn’t make someone hallucinate.” My face is on fire just having this conversation. <i>Is he actually accusing me of making something like this up? Does he actually believe that my own memories from my entire childhood are inaccurate?</i> I can’t make sense of this and won’t dare speak my true thoughts. I feel terrified and alone, as if the entire world is against me. The feeling reminds me of my nightmares about the end of the world from my childhood. Complete terror, lack of control, and aloneness. As if I’m evil and no matter my efforts to be good, corrupt is all I’ll ever be. Except there is no escaping or waking up from this real life nightmare.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, what about all of those times when you would bang on Josiah's door begging him to let you into his room back at the Concord house? Huh? You must have wanted it. If you didn’t want it to happen, you wouldn’t have hung around him. You wouldn’t have lived with him and Lesley a few years ago and you would have told your mom and I when you were a kid so that we could stop it. But you didn’t do that so you must have wanted it. You probably begged for it with the way you banged on Josiah's door.” I am helpless and small at the hands of his accusations, without the slightest clue how to defend myself. If he doesn’t believe my words, I don’t know what else to do.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Dad, I really don’t know what you’re talking about," I explain. “If I banged on Josiah's door it was probably because he was awful to me and took something of mine that I was trying to get back. Or maybe I did need him for something, but not this. I didn’t want this and I didn’t beg for it. I was embarrassed and didn’t want anyone to know. And I was scared of getting into trouble. I stayed with Josiah and Lesley because I wanted to stay in my school near friends and Josiah was in Iraq most of that time anyway.” My words are powerless and don’t give Dad the proof he is looking for. The conversation repeats a bit, then fizzles when neither of us back down.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the time I didn’t know that it’s impossible for people understand my experience if they aren’t willing to hear. Since my earliest memories the abuse was all I knew. I hadn’t even known that many kids don’t share the same experience of daily sexual abuse. Not only was it a normal part of my childhood, but I had feared that talking would get me into just as much trouble, if not more, than Josiah. After all, my biblical teachings and the adults in my life had drilled into me that sexual encounters outside of marriage were the worst type of sin. One that happened because a woman must be doing something to make the man lust after her. There also hadn’t been a safe person to tell even if I had mustered the courage to do so. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A few days later, Dad asks to meet again. This time, I am smarter than to go alone and bring Jenn. When Dad answers the door, his eyes shift between us, confused. “This is Jenn. She’s my boss over at the restaurant. I hope you don’t mind that I brought her for support.” He sighs and I sense his discontent with me bringing an “outsider” for support.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, come on in, I guess," he says, stepping aside to create space. The house smells of the usual wood burning stove and cigarettes. We walk to the kitchen and stand awkwardly, no one knowing what to say.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Hi, I’m Jenn," Jenn begins introductions.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad shifts on his feet, rubbing his hands through his hair as if in distress. Then, he speaks. “Can you, Jenn, wait in the other room? My wife and I need to talk to my daughter, alone.” It is a demand, not a question.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Jenn is directed to a back bedroom to wait while dad, Sylvia, and I talk at the kitchen table.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At first, Dad is silent, as if trying to collect himself. “So I’ve hired this lawyer,” he explains. “I scheduled a meeting and you will sit down and meet with him. He will tell you all of your rights and what to expect at the upcoming trial. These people, Kelly, these social workers and other attorneys that have been spewing all kinds of who-knows-what into your ears are going to make you feel like you have to talk. They are going to make you feel like you have to be angry and throw your brother in jail. But you don’t have to do that. Okay? You can go up on the stand and choose not to talk. That is your right. You can’t lie on the stand, but you can choose not to talk," he explains with his finger slamming against the table to make certain I understand the command.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A trial has already been scheduled to take place within the next month and his demands feel like a threat, <i>you will do this… or else…</i> I don’t want to know what the <i>or else</i> part might be, but just want everything to end.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Throughout this entire process, I was confused, insecure, terrified and shocked. There was so much pressure on me and expectations flying from all directions. Police and social workers drilled me for the most detailed descriptions of what had happened. Yet my family demanded I stay silent. I had stepped outside of the family norm and they expected me to get back in line, but I couldn’t. Getting back into line meant returning to the emptiness, fear and disgust I felt toward myself. Over the weeks individuals dismissing my experience made me want to talk even more. I had been shoved down so much that survival would come through an explosion of retaliation. The process may not have started from a place of anger or wanting revenge, but I felt forced into a corner and trapped. The only way out was to scream my truth.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Immediately after leaving Dad’s, I face one glaring truth: my family isn’t safe. I am realizing that all along, the problem might not have been me, but them. When reflecting on my life, I realize that I have been shamed and silenced each time I have shared a truth or showed glimmers of my authentic self. I can't do it anymore because it’s destroying me. Suddenly, I know what I have to do. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is a particular feeling. A moment of clarity. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The Holy Spirit, guardian angel, or maybe a personal intuition is speaking to me. A voice inside me that somehow knows the next right step. The one guiding me so well that I know everything will be okay if I just follow it. Something has to give and it won’t be me. Not this time. If saving myself means taking down the entire family, then that’s what I will do. I will do anything to shatter the horrific abuse dynamics and save myself, no matter the cost. Because sometimes, things need to be destroyed in order for something new, better, and more beautiful to grow. 
										<br>

										<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;From what I know, Grandma Williams hasn’t learned of my disclosure yet and I don’t want to face her. Corbin moved out of Jenn’s earlier in the year and she has offered me their extra room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At my first availability, I move out of Grandma’s. She isn’t home when I pack, and I race the clock to avoid crossing paths. While gathering my belongings, I receive a text. This time, it is from Abe asking if he can come for a visit. Again, I hope, <i>Yes, Abe! I am so relieved. He is the sibling who I am closest with who will truly get it. He will understand and hug me and tell me that everything is going to be okay.</i> I breathe a huge sigh of relief.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he arrives, he does hug me, then asks what is going on. I again explain the series of events but this time feel confident sharing with someone in the family who will be on “my side”.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He tries to empathize, then states, “You know Kelly, Josiah was sexually abused by Glen. He only did that because of what he went through.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, Abe, I know that. I feel bad about that. About all of this. I didn’t mean for any of it to happen. But, it happened, and I can’t lie when people ask me.” I sit on the edge of my bed at grandma’s, not knowing what else to say.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, you know you don’t have to talk. Josiah is facing serious charges and could go to jail for a long time. They are saying twenty-five to thirty years in prison, then life on parol and the sex offender list. His entire life will be over.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“And I’m sorry about that. But I don't know what else to do. This is out of my hands…”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You can do something. You can choose not to talk. I know many girls who have been sexually abused. There’s Laura, and Candice, and Melony, and so many more. They didn’t send their perpetrators to jail and they are all fine. You will be okay without sending him to jail too. I promise.” He is desperate for me to hear him, but I can’t agree.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Abe, that sounds horrible, and I seriously hope those girls are getting some sort of help.” Deep inside, my insecurity wonders how all of those girls he knows are fine while I am not. <i>What does that mean about me? And what does it mean for this to be a normal thing for Abe and the surrounding culture?</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look, all I’m saying, is that you don’t have to send him to prison just because you’re pissed.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;That is it. I can’t hear it again--the idea that I am a bad person trying to get revenge. People assume I am angry rather than acknowledging and validating my experience of pain. No one understands me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Now, I am short and to the point, implementing boundaries, a word that my new therapist has taught me. “I think that you should leave, Abe.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Woah, I didn’t mean to make you mad.” Even if he doesn’t mean to make me mad, he is.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I know, but I am mad and you need to leave," I say again, feeling stone cold and numb.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly after he leaves, I receive a text from Josiah saying something like, “Hey Kelly, I am really sorry about everything that happened. Can we talk? They are talking about prison time and this is really serious.” I am on the living room floor now, frozen, with a dry mouth, trying to make sense of Josiah texting me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The police have given me clear instructions: “If Josiah reaches out to you, do not respond and do not have any contact with him.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A few minutes later, when I don’t respond, another text comes. “Kelly, I said I am sorry. Can we please talk? Please Kelly. I am really sorry. This is serious. Please Kelly.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I close his text and message Elizabeth; her responses always bring me comfort. When I tell her I haven’t replied, she writes, “Oh my gosh, you did the right thing. You are so brave and so strong. I am proud of you. You amaze me and are stronger than anyone I know. Even in the darkness, you shine bright. What are some thoughts and feelings you’re having?” She barely knows me, yet consistently loves me better than those who know me best, including my own mother. I cling tightly to her words as my new lifeline.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At Jenn’s, I live with her daughters, Cassie and Sam, and their stepdad, Blake. The house is old and rundown, but still functioning and I sleep in a small room that houses the furnace. The home is poverty-stricken, but the people are safe. Jenn continues listening to me both at work and home. Cassie, my best friend, proves to be a big support. And Sam, who is in seventh grade, fills me in on all of her middle school drama. When the days end, Cassie sneaks to her boyfriends and Sam, fearing being upstairs alone, begs to sleep with me. She is a refreshing break from everything happening in my life. Most nights, we laugh hours into the night until our bellies hurt. Then we fall asleep talking about whether God or aliens are real. These relationships carry through the next years.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One day, I receive a Facebook message from a cousin in Texas stating that she has heard about everything going on and wants to check in on me. She then explains that Grandma Williams told her about my disclosure.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>What?</i> I wonder. <i>That’s weird because Grandma hasn’t said a thing to me.</i> I had thought that when Grandma learned the news, she would at least check in on me. Now I feel humiliated that she has spread the news all the way to Texas. Immediately, I text her to schedule a time for talking in person.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Leading up to the meeting, I rehearse my lines, longing to continue being the brave, strong and bright shining girl that Elizabeth sees in me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Jenn needs me to drive Sam somewhere and due to time constraints, this requires that I bring her to my meeting at Grandma’s. I set her up in the living room with the television and meet Grandma in her sunflower themed kitchen. The sunflowers are everywhere--on the wallpaper, dish-ware, tablecloths, and wall decorations. I have always wondered the reason behind the sunflowers but never asked.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For this conversation, I start. “Hey Grandma, so extended family has been reaching out to check if I am okay with everything going on. When I asked where they heard about it, it sounds like it has come from you. I appreciate that they are checking in but also do not want a lot of people to know about this. It is very personal to me and I am wondering if you could not tell anymore people until I can sort this out," I explain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The first words out of her mouth ingrain in my mind, never to be forgotten. “You can’t tell me what to do!" 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I try to express my feelings as non threatening as possible, yet fail. Her defenses are up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Grandma, I’m not trying to tell you what to do. This is just really personal to me and I feel uncomfortable with so many people knowing what is happening," I explain further, but she cuts me off.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, you can’t tell me what to do! I will talk to who I want, when I want, about what I want. And do you have any idea what you are putting your mom through? She called me crying, ready to take her own life over this! You should call her and apologize for putting her through this.” It is at this moment that I notice the pattern: Grandma sounds just like Mom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Putting Mom through what? This isn’t about Mom. I am just trying to get help and if Mom is making this about her, then I don’t know how to stop that.” This is not in my script, but I also hadn’t anticipated such a response from Grandma. It feels like everyone expects me to care about their needs, but no one even acknowledges mine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, you are putting your mom through too much. If you are going to tear this family apart, then you can get out of my house right now!” She is shouting while walking toward the living room. She looks to Sam and continues. “And you too! Get out! Get out of my house. Kelly, you take your lowlife hoodlum friend and get out of my house! You are no longer welcome here!” Sam and I rush for our coats and boots while grandma follows us out the door shouting.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sam is only twelve years old, knowing little about my circumstances. I apologize profusely, even calling Jenn to explain the situation. “Had I known my grandma would react like that, I never would have brought Sam. I am so sorry Jenn.” Thankfully, she is understanding.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I return to my room at Jenn’s, I sit on the bed and call Elizabeth. It has been weeks and is the first time since disclosing that I cry. I cry so hard that I’m unable to catch my breath, hoping Elizabeth can take my pain away. I know she wishes the same, but she can’t. She can, however, continue speaking the same words of comfort, validating my feelings and reminding me I’m not alone. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t have words Kelly. I am so sorry that you are going through this. It doesn’t make sense. You don’t deserve this. You deserve so much more. You are stronger than I ever could be and everyday I am amazed by you. You truly amaze me.” Thinking back, I don’t know that she will ever understand the comfort and strength she brought me during those moments.
										<br>
										</p>
										~
										<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;I’m not particularly close to Chase, but one night he ordered takeout from the restaurant while I worked. When picking the food up he said, “Kelly, why are you doing this?” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I spit out some answers similar to what I had told the others then returned to work. His question was enough for me to know where he stood. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As I cry to Elizabeth, it feels official. Aside from a few friends, disclosing my abuse has cost me every relationship. The damage is done and I am more aware of this than ever. There will be no turning back.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth's words bring safety, love, and peace, but they can’t take away this aching pain. Being vilified and detested by my entire family--my parents, my siblings, and even my grandmother--is too much to bear. I hangup from our conversation and head straight for the bathroom where I grab a new shaving razor  and tear it apart. Once a single razor is free, I sit on the toilet and slit rows up my forearm. I don’t cut to kill myself. I don’t even cut because I want to hurt myself. Instead, the slices resemble the wounds I have experienced at the hands of others. Feeling them in my heart is one thing, but I need to see them. “This cut is from Abe. This one is from Mom. This one is Grandma… and Shannon… and Dad…and Josiah...” Continuing down the list, I wonder if they even care about the pain they have caused. Surprisingly, I find the experience grounding. Over the next months and years each time I feel the tight slits under my shirt, whether I be in bed, at school, or work, It’s my reminder not to trust. <i>Yes, I feel you. You are hurting. They caused you this pain. I remember and I won’t forget.</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I finish, I head to bed and pray my new nightly prayer. “Lord, I don’t have anything left in me. If I wake tomorrow, it has to be you getting me out of bed, because I can’t do it. There is nothing left of me. It all just hurts so much. Please Lord, let me die. Whether it be a car accident or sickness or some other wound, please, if you’re real, just let me die. Have mercy on me by letting death save me from this pain. It’s too much. Please Lord, if you could do me this one favor and just take me away from this world…” I beg harder than I have ever begged for anything, as I lack strength to take my own life. This prayer continues until sleep overtakes me. For years to follow, it remains my mantra.

									<h2><i>Family Matters</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Christmas comes with more pain. My parents quickly pay Josiah's bail for his first arrest, then Mom directly informs me that I will not be welcome to Grandma Williams’ for Christmas dinner.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“This might be our last Christmas with Josiah for a long time and we want to spend it together," she explains, attempting to justify her actions for choosing him over me. When Christmas is finally important to mom, I’m not welcome. What I didn’t know at the time is that this would be the first of many holidays I would be uninvited to, until one day the invitations would stop coming all together.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The entire family, even extended family, which I would later learn, always had excuses for him. Whether it be past trauma, his current circumstances of facing jail time, or his “good character” for serving in Iraq, there was always something. I was the worldly child who smoked marijuana, had too many emotions, didn’t respect my elders, and chose to expose family secrets. All of this meant I had no place in the family. Bending to their wishes would mean abandoning myself. The cost was too high.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Elizabeth learns that I’ve been uninvited for family Christmas, she invites me to her own parents’ home for dinner and a gathering. She has known me four months as a student, but only one on a more personal level. Within that short time, it seems she has seen enough to know the extent of my family’s dysfunction. Thinking back it would have been easy for her to walk away, wishing me the best. I imagine that most people would have feared what could come with my family’s unpredictable tendencies and done just that. Instead, she invited me deeper into her life, choosing to join my journey into the darkness. There are still no words for the amount of gratitude I have from these acts of love and acceptance.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth’s words of support and encouragement continue, now including stuff like, “You continue to amaze me. You have such good perspectives and are wise beyond your years. You will go far in this world. I know it doesn’t feel like it right now, but one day you will have full control over your life and you will live nothing less than the life that you want. You will find what you’re looking for.” She is speaking words of hope, reminding me that the situation will pass. My life can one day be whatever I want it to be.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I feel shame and embarrassment for accepting an invitation to something as intimate as family Christmas, but am more scared of being alone--the thoughts are too dark there.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her parents' home is older, yet well-kept, reminding me of Grandma Reed’s house. The inside air is warm, cozy, and smells of a freshly cooked meal. She introduces me to her husband, Jake. Similar to her, he is tall, with blonde hair and blue eyes. Their kids are just as she described them. Logan, age eight, with wavy blond hair. Nathan, age five, with curly red hair. Lastly, Ezra, eleven months old, completely bald. The home is also filled with aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents. Everyone welcomes me with smiles and open arms.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As thankful as I am for a place to spend the holiday, it isn’t home. At points throughout the night I feel panic followed by an instinct to run away. Then, the thoughts, <i>I will just go home. I will apologize to my family for everything and tell them that they are right, I am a selfish bitter person who made all of this up for attention. I will tell them I am so sorry and won’t do it again. Things will go back to normal and it will be like none of this ever happened.</i> Then I remember, there is no “undoing” my disclosure to law enforcement.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth’s gift to me is a pink puffer vest and a small cross with the quote “You are so loved” written on the back. With it there is a sweet note, inspiring courage and hope. For the first time in almost eighteen years, someone sees me. It feels as if Elizabeth has reached the little girl inside of me and is saying, <i>I see all of these broken pieces that people keep smashing down. They are heavy. Here, let me pick them up and hold them with you. Because they are you and they are beautiful.</i> Her unwavering love gives me strength to continue taking each next step forward.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The idea that <i>just when things can’t get any worse, they do</i> feels more true than ever. Just days after Christmas my friend, Chrystal, gets pulled over by the police for having a license plate light out while driving to a New Year’s Eve party. Even the reason she has gotten pulled over feels ridiculous. <i>A license plate light? Really?</i> I hadn’t even know those were a thing until this night. After letting her off with a warning, the police officer looks to me and asks “Miss, how old are you?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m seventeen,” I reply, not paying much attention.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Then why do I see a pack of cigarettes in your purse?” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he asks for my drivers license, I provide it without speaking a word, unable to even look at him. Although I will be of legal age in less than two months, he writes me a ticket and I am scheduled for a court date. I want to scream at him, “Do you have any idea what I am going through?! Do you?! Because if you did you would know that the least thing I deserve is a fucking cigarette.” But the words stick in my throat. I don’t want another court date but getting off out of pity feels worse.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Chrystal speaks after putting the car in drive, but I can’t hear the words. Instead, the panic comes full force. “Help! I need out of this car. I need out. Right now! I need out! I need out! Get me out!” My hands are hitting the door next to me, as if this will get me out of the car. Then, I find the door handle and pull repeatedly, floundering for the lock and failing to find it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We are going nearly fifty-five miles per hour down a back country road, but my brain can’t process being in a moving car. It just needs space from the world caving in on me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Woah, Kelly! What is happening?! What are you doing? Don’t open the door! The car is moving!” Chrystal screeches.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Something about the panic in her voice brings sense back into me. “I just need air! Please, pull over! I need air! I just need air!” I’m dizzy and drop my head between my legs, hoping this will help my breathing. I’m not sure why I do this, other than that my mom used to do it to stop from passing out on occasion. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she finally parks in a lot, I scramble from the car and fall to the ground crying. It is heavy and uncontrollable, then silent choking cries once I can know longer breathe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, after I don’t know how long, the winter wind thrashes at my face, pulling me back into the moment. The more I focus on the freezing of my tears, the easier my breaths become until finally, things slow. I lean against the car, exhausted, not wanting to leave the cool air.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, Chrystal approaches me, asking about next steps. She is a coworker and classmate but knows little of my family circumstances. I am desperate to not ruin her night because of my episode. After pulling my weak body to its feet, I wipe the tears and we finish our drive to the New Year’s Eve party. The party is noisy, dark, and overcrowded. As the designated driver, I refuse to drink, but do get high, hoping to relax enough for my company to be more enjoyable for others. On this night, it doesn’t work. I feel tense and my laughs are fake. People speak to me but I struggle to process their words, anxious to return home to Jenn’s. 
										<br>
									</p>
										~
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;That next week I meet with Dad’s attorney. Prior to the meeting, I receive a call from my older brother, Jacob. “Hey, I just want to check in and see how you are doing.”  Being eleven years older than me, he moved out when I was only seven years old, so I don’t know him well, aside from the rare occasions Mom took us to visit him in Grand Rapids where he lived. I dread another family interaction, but am pleasantly surprised when--after I explain the situation with Josiah, the attorney and everything else--he responds with, “I am trying to think of ways I can be there for you. How can I support you?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This is unlike any interaction I have had with family members. <i>How can he support me? I haven’t had to think about that and don’t even know how to answer this question,</i> I think to myself. My eldest brother, James had also reached out to me. Although James offered support, my guard remained up. He had taken the route of sharing some of his own childhood struggles and I didn’t know how to connect in that way. Not with a man.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Jacob’s response doesn’t include any of that. He doesn’t offer advice or shared experience. Similar to Elizabeth, he meets me in my pain and trusts me to know what I need. By the time we finish talking, he has agreed to come with me to speak with the lawyer. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Per Dad's instructions, we all meet at his house, then ride together. Upon arrival the attorney explains “I need to speak with her alone.” Dad disagrees, but the lawyer won’t have it. Finally, with a tight jaw, he cooperates.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Now, I am alone, sitting across the desk from a man with a fancy suit. “Okay, so I want to hear from you what has been going on?” he asks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I finish explaining the situation he takes a deep breath and leans back in his leather swivel seat. “You know, your father is right. By law, you are not required to talk if you don’t want to. But sitting here, listening to you, I believe, with one hundred percent certainty, that you should go up on that stand and speak your truth. Don’t hold back. There’s no reason to be silent for a situation like this. That is my professional opinion.” For the first time since being in his office, I glance up, needing to make sure he is genuine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Back in the car, Dad is desperate to hear how the meeting went. He wiggles in his seat repeating, “Okay Kelly, so what did he say? He told you your rights, correct? That you don’t have to talk. Right? What did he say?” It is when he turns to face me that I notice the new drawn lines on his face. It is as if he has aged ten years overnight and dark eye circles hang heavy. He no longer appears scary, just drained, empty, worn down and weary. But in that, I see hope peaking through, as if this meeting with the attorney will somehow change Josiah's fate.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My voice is barely above a whisper, “Well, Dad, he told me that I should talk. He said that I have a right to choose not to speak but that he is confident I should go on the stand and talk about my abuse.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Unable to look at me, his eyes now seem distant as he stares out the front window. After a deafening silence, he asks, “So what are you going to do?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m going to talk,” is all I say.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It feels as if my family has silenced me my entire life. “Kelly, you’re being too loud. Shut up.” Or “Gosh Kelly, you’re so annoying. Just stop talking.” Or “You are a liar and do everything for attention. It’s so annoying.” Or “Your voice is hurting my ears.” Finally, I have people who are not only willing to listen, but are strongly encouraging me to speak. It is empowering and validates complex emotions that I have felt for many years.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It is a silent drive back to Dad’s. When we arrive, his head falls to the steering wheel as he sobs. His tears are a desperate plea and through them he repeats out loud “What about grace? What about mercy? Where is that in all of this? Huh? Mercy? Where is mercy for my son?” I don’t know if the pleas are for me or God, but the emotions are suffocating.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The only time I have ever seen Dad cry prior to this was three years before when Mom and George went on their honeymoon. I stayed with him for three weeks and nearly every night, he wept at his computer desk, grieving the loss of his marriage. I sat near him, wanting to provide comfort but not knowing how. The tears he has today are worse.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I step out of the car, feeling the sole responsibility for my family’s pain. Jacob meets me outside the car and wraps his arms around me for a tight hug. “What do you need? Should I come with you?” he asks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I will be fine. It looks like he needs you more than I do right now. I just want to be alone," I explain, truthfully. People, no matter who they are, feel exhausting.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By this point, I’m second-guessing everything. Even having a basic conversation triggers anxiety. <i>Did I say something that could be used against me? Do they think I’m lying? Am I showing too much emotion? Not enough emotion?</i> My brain is at war. I just want to smoke my cigarettes and marijuana alone while re-reading all of Elizabeth’s texts until they feel true. That feels safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The following Monday night, Elizabeth meets me at the courthouse. We are to talk with the prosecutor and discuss what to expect in the court hearing, which is scheduled for the following morning. We are both tense, neither of us knowing what to expect.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The prosecutor is a woman wearing business clothes with a tight bun in her hair. She starts by stating “So, good news! I just got off the phone with Josiah and he has agreed to accept the plea bargain.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Elizabeth and I look at each other, then she asks, “Okay, so what does this mean?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, I am not sure what changed his mind, especially this last minute. Earlier today he was set on going to trial, but this means you no longer need to testify tomorrow! The two charges for you and your sister under the age of twelve will be dropped and only the one when you were thirteen and older will remain. He will be sentenced four months in jail, six years of probation, and will be on the sex offender list for life,” she explains.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Everyone in the room breathes sighs of relief. “That’s good, right Kelly? This is what you wanted?” Elizabeth looks at me, knowing my biggest fear has been Josiah getting a serious charge and my family hating me for it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, this is good. It is!” I attempt to convince myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t mean it. I had hoped that a smaller sentence would enable my family to love and accept me again but at this point, know that is unlikely. Deeper inside, I’m having unspeakable thoughts, <i>How did his sentence just go from twenty-five years in prison to four months in jail? Is fifteen years of sexual abuse only worth that? How did his charges for abusing me and Sarah under the age of twelve, the majority of the abuse, get dropped? Does the court think I am overreacting and that this wasn’t a big deal too? How can they just drop two charges?</i> It doesn’t make sense and over the following months, I will learn that Elizabeth feels just as confused. Every so often, a comment, such as, “I still can’t believe he got such a ridiculous plea bargain. It doesn’t make sense," slips from her. When this happens, she changes the topic quickly, as if not wanting to put her own emotion from the experience onto me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You can still come to court tomorrow, but you don’t have to.” The prosecutor continues.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, I guess I am… I still want to go. I want to be there," I state.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you sure?” They both look surprised.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I’m sure. I want to go just in case," I explain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Nobody asks for clarification about what “just in case” means. I hadn’t entered into this situation angry, but my family’s responses have left a boiling rage in me. One that I now direct toward Josiah. <i>He knows this is true! And still, he’s going to stand by while the family treats me like this. He’s going to watch me suffer rather than tell the family to back down.</i> For some reason, I assumed he had more humanity in him than that. It seems that he has accepted the plea bargain for fear of the trial not leaning in his favor rather than because he takes genuine accountability for his actions. I hide these thoughts and feelings though, refusing to be what my family thinks of me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Today, many years later, I confess. What it meant was “just in case I still get the chance to testify”. As terrified as I was, some part of me wanted to speak in court. He could lie to everyone, but I imagined staring him straight in the eyes during my testimony, showing him my power. He would look at me and we would both know the truth of it all. I would be taking back full control of my body and life.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This plea bargain, similar to my family’s responses, was a kick in the fucking gut.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During this time, Elizabeth introduces me to another “support”, Angela. Elizabeth is unable to make the court date, so Angela comes in her place. She is a middle-aged mom, working toward her master’s degree in social work. Similar to Elizabeth, she has a gentle and compassionate spirit. One day, I remember her saying, “You are so resilient. I am amazed by it.” She then had to explain what the word “resilient” meant, as I had never heard it before. After she did, she held her hand in a fist. “You see this?” She said. “There is so much darkness right now. And you are in the midst of a long journey. But this hand, right here, that is going to resemble a light at the end of this dark tunnel. Because light is coming. It always does. You are not alone and I am going to be right here, helping you search for this light," she explained. It was as if she were becoming another person in my corner.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Even more amazing, was the reality that Elizabeth, Angela and Cynthia--who I would later meet--brought the same feeling of comfort and safety that I had when praying as a little girl. A feeling that everything was good and nothing evil could touch any of us. We were safe, protected, and strong. It was as if something spiritual were pulling us together for a greater purpose. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Upon arriving to court, Angela sees Uncle Chad, who my dad brought for support. She turns to me and says, “Oh my gosh Kelly, Chad Cole. You are related to Chad Cole? I knew that I recognized the name Cole!” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It turns out, she knows him from church and other local community circles. My dad’s brother, Uncle Chad and his wife, Aunt Lydia--the ones we spend Thanksgiving with--have always been the most “normal” people in our entire family. Chad is Dad’s brother and the spitting image of him in physique, except Uncle Chad never gives off unkind vibes and Aunt Lydia is sweet as they come. Even their adult children are successful. I make a joke in reply, “Ya, that’s my uncle. I was so close to having a normal childhood, right?” Thinking back, I wonder why they chose to stand by dad’s side rather than than checking in with me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Later, I will learn that Angela lived one street over from Grandma Reed. You can nearly see Grandma’s house from her backyard. Between Angela running in the same circles as my family and Elizabeth attending the Christian School with my brothers, all of us coming together at this moment felt like divine intervention. It was as if God’s angels, Elizabeth and Angela were close to me, even as a little girl, just waiting for this awestruck moment. Many years later, I would even learn that Angela had met Iva Gilligan, who ran that odd bible quizzing event I attended as a child. All along, my safe people were so close, yet somehow so far away. Today, I take comfort in the safety of their closeness, even as a little girl.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When entering the courtroom, I see my parents and older brothers on Josiah's side, but Jacob stands in the back of the room as a neutral observer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;They don’t need me to testify, but the attorneys circle, having a whispered argument and then gesture for me to come forward. My head feels light and my mouth goes dry as I approach. “We need to know the exact date of the last time he tried to touch you," they explain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This debate over dates of sexual abuse incidences has been happening between lawyers, my family, and me for weeks. My parents and Abe don’t believe my answer, no matter how hard I try to prove my honesty. The one date people fixate on, is when Josiah tried touching me in Grand Rapids at James and Monica’s house following his twenty-first birthday celebration. Lawyers, parents, and siblings have decided that if they are going to find flaws in my disclosure--if they are going to prove Josiah's innocence--it will be because I could have gotten this specific date wrong. If they can prove that, then I could be dismissed as a liar, making this up just to get someone in trouble. My family and their lawyers don’t care about my wellbeing. It is a strategy to discredit me and make Josiah into a hero who survived his own abuse.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I had thought Mom’s mind fucks were bad, but this court experience is horrific. I had feared that people would be disgusted with my disclosure, as even I was repulsed with myself about the abuse. But I never imagined people wouldn’t believe me. Or that people were capable of going through such lengths to bury my memories. It is no wonder women refuse to come forward about their abuse. Because this court experience created more mental trauma for me than any of the others combined. I didn’t matter. My story didn’t matter. My wellbeing didn’t matter. My memories and experiences didn’t matter. The system's goal, just like my family, was to prove me “crazy” to protect another white male. I went from being trapped in the family to being trapped by the system. They asked for the most explicit details then turned on me, ripping me open just to bury me. The ultimate mind fuck. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah did not celebrate his twenty-first birthday in Grand Rapids," they declare. I attempt to explain that although it might not have been a twenty-first birthday exactly, he did go to the bars with them so he was twenty-one. And the movie <i>The Hangover</i> played that night, which I fact checked and had been released that same year. These are details I give to prove myself, but I shouldn’t have needed to.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uh, I already told you. It was around his twenty-first birthday," I explain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, but when exactly? We need a date. An exact date," the lawyers state.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know. I don’t have an exact date. I just know that it was his twenty-first birthday and he came back drunk and watched ‘The Hangover’ and tried later that night.” Eventually, they accept my answer and direct me toward my seat. The entire process has been a nightmare and I again feel vilified by the court system. Just like with my family, I wonder <i>Why don’t they just believe me?</i>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah accepts the plea bargain and will begin his sentence in February, the following month.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;<i>They all got what they want and the worst is over. Now we can move on,</i> I hope. Instead, what follows will be many years of continued emotional abuse based on this event. My family swarms to protect Josiah and accuses me of “destroying” his life by “putting him on the sex offender list”. My family still shames me for getting “revenge” yet has taken it upon themselves to punish me forever. Life is forever changed. No turning back.
