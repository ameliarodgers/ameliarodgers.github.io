									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The brain has an incredible ability to heal and change throughout its lifespan. Everyone brings a unique set of individual strengths to this life. My hope is that my writing will assist individuals throughout their own healing process and provide tools for those walking alongside others who share similar experiences to mine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I grew up in Southwest Michigan and moved to Grand Rapids in 2012 to continue my education in social work. My hobbies include spending time with loved ones, enjoying the outdoors, writing, reading, and making memories with my dog, Arya. My perfect day includes time spent in meaningful conversations and sharing many laughs with close friends. I believe that our closest connections are what build resiliency and strength as we navigate the joys and hardships of life.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This blog will include many details relating to physical, sexual, mental, and emotional abuse. If trauma stories such as this are something that might trigger you, I encourage you to do what is best for yourself even if that means refraining from reading this blog or moving at a pace that works well for you. If you are someone who finds such topics helpful in your own life then grab a blanket, cozy up, and join me during this chapter of my journey.
										<br><br>
										Much Love,
										<br>

									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Barely tall enough to peer over the top of the mattress, I stand at the foot of my parents’ bed. Crammed into the back room of our tiny mobile home, the bed and dressers leave little space for movement. Evening is setting in and the sun gleams through the window, leaping off the back of the figure in front of me. It is a man. Sitting tall and colossal, he speaks to me. Glancing up curiously, I wonder why he has brought me here. I am only four  years old, and it is all so bewildering to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Where were my parents? I ask now. True to character, Dad must have been downing drinks at the corner tavern. And Mom must have been at church, or more likely, socializing with another man for attention. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You do this and just put your mouth on it," the strange man educates steadily, as if to teach me something valuable. My brain has reduced his face to that of a shadow being engulfed by the gazing sun. What I know for certain is that the man in the memory is not my older brother, Josiah. My first perpetrator is not the one whom my childhood self would soon know as my full-time abuser. This man was different, older, taller, yet a person whom I must have known well at the time. Eyes shifting down to the long body part in front of my face, I squint in confusion, feeling uncertain while continuing as instructed. This is my very first memory. Innocence stolen so young that I will never know what life prior to abuse was like. The trauma memories would remain trapped in the body for years to come, attempting escape through murmurs so indistinct that their silent echos would remain buried.

									<h2><i>Illusion</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was born and raised in a pleasant beach town called South Haven, and I truly wish my life’s story reflected the beauty of its majestic dunes, birch trees, and gentle waters. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Situated just below Canada and shaped like a mitten, Michigan is known for its grueling winters: freezing temperatures, heavy snowfalls, and dark skies. But by the month of June, warm summer breezes shift the skies from gloomy to pleasant, and the ghost town of South Haven becomes a resort town bustling with tourists who enjoy the quaint shopping district, high-end seasonal restaurants and long sandy beaches of Lake Michigan. Some say that on a clear day, the Chicago skyscrapers can be seen from across the lake, others argue that is just an illusion--for the Windy City is a full one hundred miles across the freshwater lake.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The lake bluffs are filled with million dollar vacation homes owned largely by people from Illinois, whom locals refer to as FIPs, “Fucking Illinois People”. Although the visitors keep the town financially afloat, warm months come with too many people crammed into a small space and it feels suffocating to me. As the season ends and the town empties, the low income residents like my family go back to living their hard-scrabble lives and scraping by with limited resources. The wealth of the area is an illusion for us too.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Many say that even with this duplicity, I am lucky to grow up in such a picturesque place. In some ways, I agree. But in others, I contemplate what being born in a different location, with an entirely different family, might have been like for me. Had I grown up in a nurturing environment with love, acceptance, and structure, would I be the person I am today? Would I be something greater? Or worse? Would I even wonder about this? These are questions which I will never know the answer to because I wasn’t raised in a safe, caring home. Far from it. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Just two miles from the beach, South Haven quickly transitions into the countryside which is where Dad bought fifty acres of deer hunting land many years prior to my birth. On this swampy, flat land was a mobile home trailer that housed nine children, two adults, and entirely too many animals over the next twenty years.  And, for the longest time, the memories of the land and its people were lost to me, but once I recalled it all, I knew I must share it all.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;On February 20, 1994, I was born in the small white trailer with brown shutters located on County Road 384. After many hospital births, Mom felt God calling her away from worldly Western medicine. It was a Sunday morning and her midwife, Marian, helped deliver me in my parents’ bed.  There would be no medical intervention for labor--not even a simple aspirin--for this was deemed unholy. Like all of the women in Mom’s evangelical Christian community, Marian didn’t cut her hair because it was immodest and worldly to look anything but a proper female, pure as the Virgin Mary. Her dark brown tresses grew well past her waist, but would have been pulled back into a single, tightly woven, French braid for “women’s work” such as this. Her face was always calm, unadulterated, and supported by a peaceful character. I imagine she and Mom sharing tears that night as they realized that after five boys, Mom had finally birthed the daughter that she spent so many years praying for.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At only nineteen years old, just months after my parents married, Mom birthed my eldest brother, K.J.. A few years later came Jason, then another gap before she had Josiah. After that, Mom gave birth every two years to: Chase, Abe, and then me. Once I came along, Mom decided that God trusted her to have as many offspring as she could.  Thus came Sarah, Daniel, and then at age forty, her final child, Avalon. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We don’t have many photos of all eleven of us together because by the time the last two came around, the first two had already moved out of the trailer. Our best family photo was before Avalon’s birth--and Mom was beyond excited. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Here Kelly, put on this dress!” she hurriedly instructed after tying my wavy blond hair back with a lace bow. She had made a special trip to Walmart for the dress. It was pretty, laced, and in my favorite color, light pink. After some shouting, complaining, and spit-shining, the ten of us piled into our twelve passenger church van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The wait outside of the “Walmart Portrait Studio” was a long one for the ten of us. We had to stay clean, groomed and well-behaved for what seemed like hours. Legs aching from waiting in line, our turn finally arrived. Mom’s enthusiasm was shared by Dad as we rushed to gather for our picture. Unexpectedly, things became tense. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You can’t turn us away! We came all this way to have our picture taken!” Dad yelled at the photographer. You see, there are things that we forget to take into consideration with big families, one of them being the fact that we might not all fit into a discount store’s little photo room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was able to tune out the harshness of Dad’s voice by focusing on my aching legs, itchy dress, and dolls waiting at home. Tension continued to build in the air as the shouting continued, then we abruptly returned to our van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once home, desperate to help Mom get her family picture, Dad set up his camera in our front yard. “You, sit here!” Dad commanded. “And you, stand here,” he directed my older brothers. The camera timer was set, and I squinted a half smile into the bright sun, anxious for the event to be over. We stood at attention: Dad in his best church shirt from JC Penney’s and cleanest jeans, Mom in her hand-sewn prairie dress that draped to the ground, and the nine children with at-home haircuts and traditional, modest clothes. 3, 2, 1 and there it was: a snapshot of the Cole's in front of the pine trees in all our finest. Looking happy. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But, I could not shake the sadness inside of me about Mom not getting the professional photos she hoped for. It was the first time my chest and stomach felt the aching need to take care of her, a feeling that stayed with me for years to come.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;Months later, the time grew closer for our family to welcome Avalon into this world. The seasons were changing, winter struggling to decide if it was ready to let spring in. The air was cold, barely warm enough for rain to wash away the snow. Throughout Mom’s pregnancy I travelled with her to a small town, Paw Paw, for monthly checkups with Marian. I noticed with curiosity that this town had poles dotting the city streets. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It is a parking meter,” Mom explained, gently teaching me something new. “Here, take a quarter and put it in right there." Feeling excited, I slid the silver into the slot. There were times when I was quite young when I was filled with Mom’s warmth.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I played with baby dolls while waiting for Mom to finish her appointment.  When Marian and Mom joined me in the waiting room, they continued to discuss birthing plans, but it was all foreign to me. No one had explained to me what pregnancy or birth was. What I did know was that Mom’s belly was growing and there was a baby inside that would somehow eventually be outside and that would be my new brother or sister. But how? And why? I did not understand. Based on their deliberate tones, something big was coming. My body became jittery with uncertainty.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Looking up, I observed how big her belly was through her long button-up dress. “There’s a real baby in there?” I asked anxiously.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“There is!” Mom exclaimed then returned to her conversation. My face tensed as I continued to anticipate what was to come--but like so many other times in my life, I was left in the dark. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Mom went into labor a few nights later, I feared something seriously bad was happening. I sat in my nightgown on the couch watching her attentively. She was walking from the kitchen to the living room when she suddenly hunched over and breathed through heavy pain. Her body was an outline, barely visible by the light from above the kitchen sink. She stood up and took another step before collapsing into the shelf that Dad’s record player sat on. I approached her cautiously, wanting to hug her but knowing that I shouldn’t touch her. 
											 <br>
											 &emsp;&emsp;“Oh, yup, I think I’m in labor. And my water broke,” her words pushed through clenched teeth as she clung to the wall beside her. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Immediately, I wished that she was not having a baby. Seeing her in such pain was unbearable.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Get your shoes and coats. You are going to Aunt Katie’s for the night," Dad instructed. Everyone around me appeared frantic and jittery. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please, just let me stay home! I promise that I will be good. I don’t want to be away from Mom!” I pleaded through tears. What if something bad happens to her while I’m gone? Worry settled in. At only six years old, the fear of being abandoned was yoked to me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At Aunt Katie and Uncle Ryan’s, my heavy-chested tears remained uncontrollable. Still in my nightgown, I stood in their kitchen begging to go home. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I want Mom,” I sobbed. The acrid smell of my aunt’s hair salon wafted from the basement and my long hair stuck to the tears on my cheeks. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I want Mom. I want Mom," the words sputtered out repeatedly--emotions so unruly that plans were made, and I was brought home in the middle of the night. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sitting in the dark, quiet, and cluttered living room, I watched a war movie with Dad. My body was calm and at peace as I felt Mom’s presence from her bedroom. The terror of the birth over, I was, for now, safe.

									<h2><i>Left Behind</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;There is something profound about the intensity of certain dreams. Mom would describe my night terrors as “visions from God”--a way of Him communicating to us something that would happen in the future. As a child with deep love and admiration for her, I soaked up Mom’s words and believed this mindset. But, my childhood nightmares came strong and often--and if God was trying to tell me something, it was that I was doomed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My body jerks awake, trembling in fear. Evil looms in the air. As eyes adjust to the dark, shadows make themselves known. They are not people, but clothes strewn on the couch, floor, and bed where my siblings and parents once slept. I am left in this world alone. Lost without the people who I love and need the most.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The clock across the room reads 8:30am. Darkness fills the sky in defiance of the morning. Similar to Left Behind, Tribulation, Revelation and other apocalypse movies that I watch regularly, the rapture has come. Panicking, I burst out the backdoor of the trailer, dashing down the street to my homeschool friend, Shae’s, house. Straining through the gloom, I know the thirty days of darkness that Mom said would come during the “end times” has arrived.   
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Relief sweeps over me as Shae’s mother, Lana, opens the door.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please! You have to help me! I woke up to find that my…” My words are interrupted  as I notice her right hand. There it is. The small numbers reading “666” tattooed in black ink.  Lana’s eyes are different, darker. The evil is within her. My left hand covers the right in efforts to hide the fact that Satan’s mark does not live on me. Why would God take my family and leave me behind? I wonder. My head throbs and I search my surroundings, desperate to hide away from the evil that suddenly fills the world.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The dream skips ahead. People socialize in the basement of Kibby Church, the local Christian Reformed Church where Wednesday night youth groups and homeschool gatherings are held. A musty smell from the old chapel building stuffs the air. Standing outside the storage room, I remember Mom standing in her ankle length jean dress copying school work pages. Her long black hair held back with a fluffy bow clip.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;An aching feeling immerses itself into my stomach, chest, and throat as the copy machine hums in the empty closet. Mom isn’t here. It was just a memory, a longing for her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I scan the room and see my homeschool friends and their families mingling, moving on with life as if nothing has changed. Hiding my right hand, I notice that everyone in the room has “666” ingrained into theirs. Suddenly, Lana’s cold eyes reach mine from across the room. She has noticed my naked hand. I am exposed, no longer able to hide. Even in the dream, my choice is certain. I fear corruption more than death. My body shivers as it anticipates choosing death by a guillotine over allowing itself to be consumed by the demonic evil in the world.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I leap from the dream to a seated position on the couch. Like all other times when I am afraid, every limb of my body shudders with anxiety. I search the living room: Sarah’s four-year-old body is sandwiched against me on the shabby couch. Daniel and Abe are wrapped in blankets sleeping soundly on the toy-filled floor. It is not yet morning and although the nightmare is over, my body trembles as if the experience were real. I scamper to Mom’s bedroom and wake her. Shaky words leave my mouth faster than my brain can process them, explaining my horrific dream.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I sink into her body as she hugs me, knowing that I can never be close enough to fully feel safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh my gosh, Kelly. God has chosen you for this dream. Just like he does with me, he has spoken to you in your sleep. He has shown you a vision of things that are going to happen!” Her voice rises with energy as her certainty in this grows. This is not an abnormal response, as she often shares different dreams of God speaking to her. But this is the first time Mom interprets my dreams as being sent from God.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom believed that me being chosen by God was a gift but I wanted nothing to do with it. If this fear was God’s gift, I would rather not know.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“He must be telling you that the rapture is coming! And when it comes, it will be at 8:30 in the morning, the same time as in your dream!” Her blue eyes glisten with hope. “But Kelly…” her voice drops and her face hangs to defeat. “God must also be telling you that you are going to be left behind, just like you were in the dream." She hugs me in silence as she thinks. I focus on the softness of her cotton nightgown, absorbing the comfort of her smell. “Yes, that’s it. God is telling me that this dream is deeper. It is God telling you that you must have sinned. You need to think really hard about what you might have done to upset him, then change your heart and pray for forgiveness. Here, I will pray for your heart right now. That God will heal you and change you to live in a way that pleases him." I’m already smashed into her body, but she embraces me even tighter, both of us desperate to never let go.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her eyes close as she begins to pray, her words quickly switching from English to unrecognizable gibberish. She is speaking in tongues again. According to Mom, this is her way of accessing God on another level. He is taking over her body and she is speaking to him in his language, but God speaking to me through this dream crushed my little soul. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brain searched for what I must have done to sin against God. Was it because Josiah touched me down there again? I wondered. But I always ask God for forgiveness right after! I reasoned. It settled on, but even before he touches you, you know it is wrong. You have not done enough to stop him from touching you. Yes, that must be the sin. Hopelessness overcame me as I knew that the next time Josiah came for me, my fear of him in that moment would overpower my knowledge of it being a sin and being left behind.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During the following days and weeks, I watched the clock closely at 8:30am every morning waiting in fear for my family to disappear. At six years old, emptiness filled my soul as I knew that there was nothing that I could do to stop the inevitable.
										<br>
									</p>
									<h3>
										Animals I - Ducks
									</h3>
									<p>
										<i>
										&emsp;&emsp;One year, for a science experiment, Mom bought eggs to hatch in an incubator. It was a venture that the local high school-aged homeschoolers had taken on, my older brothers included. Watching ducklings hatch was a miracle in itself. I hovered in awe attempting to understand how life was created inside of a small brown egg. How did ducklings live inside the eggs one second and outside the next? That experiment was the only glimpse of science education that I received prior to public school for mom did not want sinful teachings about the earths creation to steer us away from God.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the ducklings grew, I often watched them staying in their line, following their designated “Momma Duck” closely around the yard. It amazed me that animals could be so closely bonded--and had such strong survival skills. They knew that following their mother was safe--and that there was always safety in numbers.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A few months later I returned from a hike in the backwoods when Sarah approached me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly!” There was strain in Sarah’s voice. “The ducks are dead!” she wailed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? What happened?!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“They were hit by a car. A couple lived, but most are gone.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I continued toward the trailer, not sure what to think. In the kitchen I found Mom, attempting to keep up with endless amounts of household chores. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, did the ducks really die?” My voice was shaking. It couldn’t be true. Taking a hesitant breath through clenched teeth, Mom feigned an expression of sympathy, but her voice lacked any genuine concern, 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yup they died. You wouldn’t believe it! They all just followed each other right into the street!” Using her typical coping mechanism of turning painful events into lighthearted moments, she began laughing. “Just one, right after the other! Can you even believe it?!” she chuckled.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I rushed to the road out front , desperate to see for myself. Someone had removed the bodies, but blood and an unimaginable number of white feathers remained, layering County Road 384. My jaw and chest muscles tightened at the horrific scene, aching at the unexpected loss following a deep love connection. Not knowing what to feel, I pushed the sight from my mind. It took a while, but I was able to convince myself that the ducks lived a good life with a pain-free death. This was my own coping mechanism: following horrific events that my family was cruelly indifferent to, I recreated more pleasant outcomes in my mind. The new scenarios helped my tender heart heal.

									<h2><i>Rhett</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;I always wondered if Mom’s zealous evangelical beliefs stemmed from her younger years when she dabbled in what she called “witchcraft”. She and her younger brother, Rhett, experimented with friends when they were in their late teens and early twenties. Mom spoke of this often, mostly discussing the ouija board, crystals, spells, and enchantments. She spoke of “witches” living in South Haven, explaining that they were women who worked in the dark arts. Although she never specified what kind, she feared how these women communicated with, and worshiped, the devil. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Prior to this, she had grown up Catholic. I am uncertain what prompted her turn away from that faith, but by adulthood she hated Catholics. Her religious reasoning was because of their view of the trinity, but I never fully understood the nuances of this objection. She also believed that they “idolized the Virgin Mary” and did not put enough emphasis on God. Her detest for this faith was so strong that if I met someone who attended the local St. Basil's church, she would mutter “Ugh, she’s Catholic. We better not spend any time with their family.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Because of the evangelical church’s inclusive practice regarding “sinners”, I was able to socialize with families composed of addicts, alcoholics, convicts and child abusers, but heaven-forbid I spend time with someone who associated themselves with the Catholic faith. It didn’t make sense to me why Mom judged some people so harshly--or why someone's religious beliefs made them inherently evil. It was all so confusing to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When she left Catholicism behind, that seems like a natural breaking away from her childhood, but I sense there must have been a hard shift away from witchcraft; I can only imagine what happened. I picture her as having a welcoming personality and open mind like me, then one day naively partaking in a pagan ritual that frightened her somehow. As a child, I told myself that was why Mom is the way she is: her religious views must have come from a bad experience that scared her into believing in a punishing God. That would make sense why she was so fanatical about her brand of Christianity. But I really don’t know.  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall driving through South Haven, there were nearly ten houses that she would gesture to and warn, “A witch lives there. Don’t ever go into that house!”. A mile up the street she would point to another house, “The woman who lives there uses a ouija board and does witchcraft. Stay away from there too." These remarks came with eye rolls and judgmental tones, then she would shift to a tone of confidence. “These are all houses where Rhett and I used to do witchcraft--UNTIL GOD SAVED US!” And her eyes would glow.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Rhett died at a young age, still in his early twenties. Perhaps this was another turning point for Mom. Both she and Grandma Williams had supernatural takes on his death. Every so often throughout my childhood, Mom would wake up and excitedly tell us, “I had a dream about your Uncle Rhett last night! He was dead after being trampled by a horse but then he woke up and started talking to me! It is a vision from God that Rhett is alive and in heaven with him! He must have prayed and gotten saved right before he died!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One time, Mom’s dream went as far as: “Uncle Rhett told me that I will have a kid who will become a pastor! And that kid is Jacob! It’s a sign from the Lord! Oh thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus!” Her eyes were always glowing after such dreams. Her spirit and energy lifted. No sign of the heaviness that she usually carried. This made me uncomfortable. It felt as if she interpreted everything in her life being about God. It was an obsession that took priority over the wellbeing of her kids--something she couldn’t overcome. I didn’t understand why a dream couldn’t just be a dream. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During a time when I lived with Grandma Williams, she shared her viewpoint: “Rhett was always hanging out with those friends who did witchcraft. Finally, he came to me, and said, ‘Mom, I’m done. I can’t do it anymore and have decided to stop hanging out with those friends.’ And he did! Then one day, his friend wanted him to come over and talk. I told Rhett not to go, that he would just get sucked back into it. But he said he wanted to go anyway." Her voice was heavy with regret and disappointment of not trying harder to stop him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Gram’s hair was short and dyed red to cover the grey, and she had a long scar under her chin from when she had surgery to remove extra skin. A golden necklace with an oval trinket always hung from her neck, a gift that Rhett gave her just weeks before his death. She continued, “He was on his way there when the drunk driver hit him. The car caught fire and he was trapped.”  They had to use the “jaws of life” to get him out. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the hospital, they learned that the majority of his body had fourth degree burns. If he lived, his body would remain severely scarred and the healing process would be excruciatingly painful as his nerves healed. Grandma made the tough decision for the doctors to “pull the plug”.  She came to terms with his death by explaining: “I believe that if Rhett had made it to his friend’s house, he would have gotten sucked back into witchcraft. I think that God let him die as a way of saving him from that.” I always felt confused by this response, wondering why a God with such power would choose to kill someone over intervening in some other way.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom developed a similar mindset about life, believing that when good things happened to us, God was rewarding us for good behavior and when hardships came, it was a punishment from not living in a Godly way. She compared it to the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. God tested Abraham’s faith by telling him to sacrifice his own son. Then when he went to kill his son, God spared him because of his strong faith.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Grandma told the story of Rhett, her voice softened and took on a higher pitch, as if trying to fight tears. She would remove a box of his belongings from her guest room closet. Then, putting his clothes to her nose, she cried silent tears. “The cologne is in the box. It all still smells like him.”  
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For the remainder of her life, her blue Honda CR-V could be found around town with a bumper sticker that read: “A DRUNK DRIVER KILLED MY SON”.
										
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										

										&emsp;&emsp;As one might expect, the death Rhett significantly affected my grandmother and my mother, but Mom’s reaction was to cling to her evangelical beliefs with a ferocity. Since I could remember, Mom believed that Satan was regularly working to attack her for choosing God over witchcraft. Around the age of six, when I remember my doomsday nightmares starting, Mom shared her own experiences with spiritual warfare. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“When K.J. and Jacob were toddlers, your dad and I separated because he was going behind my back with another woman. One night I was sitting in bed when my bedroom lights started flickering. Then, my bed lifted off the floor and was hovering. Across the room, I saw a demon. I grabbed my bible from my nightstand and prayed. I said, ‘Lord Jesus, I rebuke this demon!’ Then suddenly, my bed went back to the floor and the lights stopped flickering. God protected me! He knew the demons were out to get me but I prayed and trusted God and he saved me! Ever since then, whenever I see a demon I just pray and it goes away because demons are scared of God. Sometimes I think God is testing me by letting the demons near me to see how I will respond.” I would listen with rapt attention to every word. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Regardless of my age, she would animatedly recount her experiences such as this and sometimes she would tell me stories of people who had been possessed and had taken on animal-like characteristics, such as squirming and hissing like a snake. The demon would be in the person's body, but their voice would change and it would talk through them. There was an entire prayer process before it would leave the person. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Usually,” she explained, “the person didn’t remember what had happened”. But when she told the story, I remembered. I always remembered.  When she spoke, I could see in my mind’s eye a man hissing on our living room floor and a pastor casting the demon out. My imagination in hearing this story made the experience real, and I felt chills in every corner of my body. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I showed my fear, she tried reassuring me, “Oh don’t worry, we are protected. Whenever you feel scared, just pray to God and Satan won’t be able to touch you.” But it didn’t work. The fear remained--as if lodged into my body for eternity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It didn’t help that she encouraged me to watch movies, such as The Apocalypse, Tribulation and Left Behind, which taught me about the “end of times” foretold in the Bible and how to identify Satan moving in the world. We must be ever-vigilant for the end of the world is coming and God’s chosen people would disappear in an event called “the rapture”. Those who were left behind would be stuck in a world ruled by Lucifer. These individuals would be forced to either get the “mark of the beast”, Satan’s numbers reading “666”, on their right hand or forehead. If they refused, Lucifer or his followers would kill them. The idea was, if you chose to die for God over following Satan, you would still get to heaven. It would teach me to know when God is testing me and how to stay strong. For years I became fixated with these movies. Memorizing every line and character. If I wanted to be safe from spiritual warfare, I would need to learn the characteristics of the good people in the movies. That is how I would survive. From these movies, I learned that I would always choose good over evil in this world, no matter how hard the fight. But at six years old, I just couldn’t suss out what was evil and what wasn’t.

										<h3>
										Animals II - Pigs and Chickens
										</h3>


										<p>
											&emsp;&emsp;At an age so young that it is barely memorable, I bonded with our pigs. The pigpen was located in a fenced area that later became our garden. Just outside the barbed wire fence in long dresses and bare feet, I spent many hours with my flat-snouted allies.  Mud squished between my toes as I kneeled, pretending to be a piglet myself. Snort, snuff, roll, grunt. I was a blissful piggy. I didn’t know that they weren’t pets. I was in the dark until one afternoon when I was in the kitchen and Mom approached from outside. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“We are getting the pigs butchered today," she announced nonchalantly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What? We can’t! I love the pigs!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“We have to, Kelly. We need the food. That is why we got them--to raise them so that we could eat them.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We did need the food. I knew that much from the number of “dumpster diving” trips that Dad was taking to Gordon Food Service, the bulk food service distributor located a few towns over. My favorite dumpster food was the variety of candy bars that he brought back. “The expiration dates are just suggestions," Mom informed us. “As long as we keep it all frozen, it never goes bad.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The freezer was filled with expired candy, milk, pizza, and vegetables. Oats, ramen noodles, eggs, and endless cereal that we normally lived on couldn’t compare to the expired gourmet meals that he brought home. And of course, anything was better than the milk that Mom made us drink straight from the local dairy farm. “It is unpasteurized and cheaper," she explained. As an adult, I wonder why she lacked concern for us potentially ingesting harmful bacteria from the raw milk. Maybe it was because, lucky for her, Mom was not a milk drinker. She never knew the disgusting taste of what she was encouraging us to consume. The off-white milk was buried by a thick yellow foam of fat and the stench was of cow's body odor--but the taste was worse. I usually resorted to eating my cereal dry.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In addition to our homegrown pork, we ate our chickens. This I wasn’t in the dark about, and it didn’t bother me much.  When Dad chopped their heads off with an axe and explained how amusing it was to watch them run around the yard headless, it was difficult for me to feel attached to them. It didn’t make sense why watching another creature die was fun, but after him chortling with bemusement at their antics, it was. Yes, I felt horrified at first, but never thought about their deaths once they were over. Well, that is until many years later when the memories flooded back in a high school classroom full of my peers and my favorite teacher. Impulsively, I joked about bloody headless chickens just like Dad had, and the eyes of terror that stared back must have been the ones that I myself gave Dad as a child. It wasn’t normal to joke about such things in the mainstream world and unfortunately, I couldn’t take my words back. I couldn’t even swallow. The embarrassment was too great. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Chickens were one thing for young me, but the grief of my piggy friends dying felt unimaginable. The idea of eating them was even worse. As I often did, I constructed a fantasy where everything turned out for the best, convincing myself that we had sold the pigs to a nice family. One that could take better care of them. “Wherever they are, they are happy," I assured myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This mindset worked well, until a rare occasion when we joined as a family to eat dinner. Gazing at the gigantic meal before us, enjoyment about eating together filled the air. It was a giant production in which we sat in order of age which meant that I dined next to my older brother Abe at the bar counter facing into the kitchen.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You know we are eating our pigs, right?” he smirked, poking to elicit a reaction.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, it’s not!” My shriek was loud. “The pigs are alive! We sold them!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sure, if that is what you want to believe," his voice remained calm and steady. “Which body part do you think is on your plate?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Stop it! We aren’t eating them!” When my tears formed, his smirk turned to a satisfied laugh.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, be quiet! Why are you yelling? You’re so annoying.” Josiah was aggravated.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, Kelly, be quiet. Your voice hurts our ears," Mom chimed in. There were always so many voices echoing through the little trailer at times like this.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My body shivered with disgust. I could no longer finish my food, but knew that I was not to leave my seat until the plate was empty. My parents rarely paid attention to me, but at times like this, there was a feigned formality. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Will you at least eat my asparagus?” I pleaded with Abe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Sure, if you take my corn.” Sneakily, we made the food switch when we were certain that no one was looking.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I remained at the counter long past when everyone else finished, unable to take more than a morsel of a bite at time. When no eyes were on me, I buried my food into the garbage. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look Mom, I finished my food! Can I get up now?” I held my breath, hoping she wouldn’t catch my lie.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, then you may be done with dinner now.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Satisfied, and with an empty stomach, I cleared my plate.

									<h2><i>Bullets and Bipolar Disorder</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom was pregnant with me during her and Dad’s worst domestic violence incident. She always said that his anger came from his younger years when he served as a United States Army Ranger. “Your dad has been through a lot. The army changed him. It really did.” Her face would convey pity. Thinking back, it was this explanation that she used regularly to justify his abusive behavior. Dad had a short fuse and when it lit, his eyes would darken into unrelenting rage and when he exploded, anything in his way would be damaged. Sometimes his momentary lack of sanity would result in us being whipped or the attacking of a pet, but other times, his blow-ups turned so violent it was criminal.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t remember the first time the “Dad shooting the tire out of Rebecca’s car” story was shared with me, but have heard it enough times from Mom and my siblings that it feels like my own memory. It was that horrific.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The story goes: Mom and Dad are arguing over something. I imagine it has something to do with Dad sleeping with another woman or being gone drinking too much. Maybe it has to do with Mom failing to keep the trailer clean or parent effectively. It’s most likely a mixture of many things which would spark a fuse. They are in the kitchen when Dad snaps, shoving Mom against the old faded wallpaper. He is choking her. Then fortunately, he gains enough control to release her.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;At some point during the argument, Mom had called her friend, Rebecca, to pick her up. She lives a mile up the street, across from the tavern where Dad spends his drunken nights. She has a humor that could bruise your belly, but she is not to be tested. When triggered, her army days left her with the same dark fury as Dad. Rebecca calls the police.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Well before the police arrive, she pulls up in her old sedan and Mom crams K.J., Jacob, Chase and Abe into the back seat. Unable to find six-year-old Josiah, she scrambles back to the trailer.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;She returns in tears, alone. “Kurt won’t let me have him! Just go. We have to get out of here fast!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the car backs out of the driveway, Dad storms through the trailer door with a gun, maybe a pistol or rifle--that part is still unclear since he has so many of them. When they reach the street, just past the white pines that line the yard, he fires.  Rebecca, who is also pregnant, doesn’t hesitate and blasts down the road with the flat tire. Within the month, she would give birth to Kelsey, my lifelong friend, but at this moment she is barreling down County Road 384 with my hysterical pregnant mother, four frightened children and a thumping tire.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Shortly after reaching her house, there is a knock on the door. Everyone sighs with relief when they find the police on the other side with Josiah, not Dad.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When we were adults, Jacob revealed to me that Dad had been pulled over and arrested just down the street. They were uncertain whether he was heading for Rebecca’s, the bar, or Canada. The police informed them they would have shot Dad on the spot had a child not been with him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Jacob also recalls that two months later Mom held a house meeting to discuss the matter of Dad nearly killing his family. “I wrote the judge a letter asking that they release your dad. I do not know why he gets so angry like that, but he doesn’t mean it. It’s just because he loves us so much. Divorce is a sin, so I have to stay with him. As a woman, I am supposed to honor my husband and should not have gotten angry back. It’s really my fault. God calls us to forgive so we will forgive your dad like Jesus wants us to.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Apparently Dad hid the evidence by dumping the gun in the backyard swamp, so between the letter to the judge and the lack of evidence, he was released from jail. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The shooting incident just became another family story. The abuse cycle continued and Mom maintained her stance of God calling her to “turn the other cheek, forgive and forget.” Her children became like ducklings, following their mother into uncertain territory, trusting she would keep them safe, only to be led toward danger. 
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall Mom and Dad’s fuming arguments came daily. One night, I sat in the living room hearing their voices roar in the kitchen. Tucked between the bookshelf and wall,  I pull my knees to my chest. I need to stay out of the warpath. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re crazy. Even the doctor said it. I heard him. He said you are bi-polar. BI-POLAR!  He said it himself and you need to take your lithium because your chemicals are all out of whack and it makes you all crazy. If you want to get better, you take your lithium. Dur dur dur. You would think it would be obvious. I never know what I’m going to get with you! You’re one way one second and a crazy person the next! Your brain is all fucked up!” Dad is taunting her in his best mocking voice while pointing at the side of his head spinning his finger in circles to indicate her being “crazy”. Mom tries to speak but he barks over her. It bellows so loud that my head feels like it might explode. I can’t even hear my own thoughts. These fights happen multiple times per week, and I’m aching for them to stop. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom screams back so hard I worry her vocal cords might rip apart. “Maybe if you were here to help take care of your kids then I wouldn’t have to be crazy! I hate you! I hate you Kurt! I wish you were dead and that I had never met you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!” She becomes louder with each sentence. But no amount of words or screaming could truly express the rage she must have felt. Years later I would learn about bipolar disorder as associated with mood swings that can range between depressive lows and manic highs that can often be managed with medication and psychotherapy. But at such a young age, I feared the worst. Was something going to happen to Mom?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I close my eyes and plug my ears, but it doesn’t drown the sound. My siblings are nowhere in sight; they must be hiding further away.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Racing to my bedroom, I bury myself deep into the closet, disappearing into darkness. Feeling torn, an internal battle begins between wanting the noise gone and needing to hear what is happening.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The moment Mom says, “I am leaving and never coming back! You can raise your kids by yourself and see how well you do!” I knew that it was time to scurry to her van quickly enough to hide in the back before she realizes I’m there. Sometimes, I hide here the moment the fights start, always knowing that this is how they end. I can’t live without my mom and staying with Dad wouldn’t be safe, so I must always be thinking of a plan.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In an effort to regain control, my mind now searches for solutions. Mom thinks we kids are too much now, but if she leaves with just me I can make her happy. Once she sees and knows me, it will be impossible for her to not love me. Mom and I can take on the world together. I will follow every instruction and stay as silent as possible--so silent she won’t even know that I am there. I will make her laugh, and it will be impossible for her to not like me. Then, there will be no way that I am too much and she will have to let me stay. I always manage to convince myself that this will work. But no matter how many times I hide in her van, she always returns me to the trailer the moment she notices.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Please Mom, just let me come with you! I will be good! I will be good! I really will Mom! I’ll be good! I promise! You won’t even know I’m here! Just please don’t leave me!” My words are frantic on her trips to drop me back off. Wanting to say the one right thing that will convince her to let me stay with her. But I can never find it. In my moment of desperation, even though it has never worked, I think that if I repeat this enough she just might be persuaded.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes she convinces me to leave the van on my own. These were rare occasions. “Are you ever coming back?” I ask earnestly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know Kelly. I just don’t know. I’m so unhappy,” is her usual response.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The times she rips me from the van, I chase her down the gravel driveway choking on tears as I beg her not to leave me. I have one focus: getting to Mom. It is survival, and my mind can’t see past this. I am desperate and searching for whatever means possible to get to her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes I chase her down County Road 384, all the way past the dump, until her van disappears. But usually I just return to the trailer where I proceed to call her cellphone on repeat. If she answers, I continue begging “Please Mom! Please let me come with you! I promise I will be good! I just want to be with you!” When she declines, I change my tactic: “Will you at least just stay on the phone with me? You don’t have to talk or say anything, just please stay on the phone with me. Don’t leave Mom. Just please. I need you.” This way, we can know we were both safe without having to talk. There’s no way I can overwhelm her if we aren’t even talking. I could be in her “presence” without overwhelming her. She would always say no and hang up.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By this time, Dad would have grabbed his beer and disappeared into the woods or his workshop, an old mobile home located in our make yard.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Each time she hung up on me, I lost more control and got more desperate, repeatedly clicking “redial” on the cordless phone. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brothers would groan in annoyance: “Seriously Kelly, why are you still crying? Just stop, you’re being so annoying.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Similar to a wild animal in survival, I could feel my eyes glazing over when raging at them. At times I would  scream until I feared my own vocal cords would split open. “SHUT UP! Leave me alone! I hate you guys! I hate you! I hate you! I HATE YOU!” My voice would grow until my throat hurt. Is this how Mom feels?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;If they pester me, I attack: hitting, scratching, and screaming until someone strong enough yanks my hair or grabs my arm so hard I retreat. My aggressive survival mode is more wild than any animal. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Mom stops answering my repeated phone calls, her voicemail clicks on: “Hi, you have reached Penny Cole. Please leave your name, number and a detailed message and I will return your call just as soon as I can. Thanks and have a blessed day.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After I fill her voicemail, I pace the trailer and yard, unable to stop myself from crying. Sometimes I wander to the street looking as far as I can, hoping to see her van approaching from the distance. Eventually, I return to the trailer and look over the back of the couch, out the front window, and down the driveway. Not daring to move my eyes until she returns. Everything in me aches and I can’t feel safe until I see her again. If she doesn’t come, I will fall asleep from exhaustion.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I reflect on these repeated memories of abandonment, I remember being so sad, empty and scared. The only thing that felt safe in the entire world was Mom, but no matter what I did or didn’t do, she never wanted me. It’s like those bad dreams when you are running away from something trying to kill you. Except in the dream, no matter how hard you try, you can only move in slow motion, getting more scared and no closer to safety until eventually, the monster, still running full speed, catches you. Mom’s reach was so close that I could almost feel the relief of safety. It was like reaching out to touch her hand and finding out it was a shadow--because each time, she ripped it away, leaving me to be devoured by the monsters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I only remember one time in which she allowed me to stay with her. I remained completely silent in the van as she drove to the beach. Suddenly, I felt safe knowing where she went when she left us behind. She often talked about going to the beach to pray alone, but my mind never made that connection because I was usually overloaded with emotions.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sitting on the blue steps at the top of the bluff, Mom cries so hard I’m not sure if she’s breathing. It is a summer night and the lakeshore breeze wafts through the air. I remain silent, listening to the crash of the Lake Michigan waves. Mom is right, the lake does have a calming effect.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Finally, she talks. Her words and tears aren’t unusual, I hear them daily. This time feels different solely because it is on a trip when she is “leaving” Dad.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I can’t do anything right," her voice shakes and pauses for more tears. “I try so hard and nobody loves me. Your Dad hates me. You kids hate me. No matter what I do, it’s never enough. I mean, I know people say they love me. But nobody really truly loves me. You know?” I don’t know, but I nod in silence, trying to know. “I wish I was dead. I can’t do this anymore.” Her tears continue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I pause to think, wondering what the one right line is that will help her. “That’s not true Mom, lots of people love you. I love you. I do love you Mom. I really do. Isn’t that enough?” My voice is focused. If I can get her calm, she will want to live. Helping her will also prove that I am not too much. If I save her, then she will love me. Then she will see that we don’t need anyone else in the world who makes us unhappy. Just the two of us and whichever siblings promise not to cause trouble can be happy together.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I know you do. But I still can’t do it. It’s too much." She cries even harder.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Did I say something wrong? I wonder.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At nine years old, I am unaware of the skills that I’m developing for talking with someone who is mentally unstable--skills that would be honed many years later as a social worker for at-risk children and adults. But at this time, it’s survival.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I need you Mom. And you do so many things right. You take care of us kids and teach us our school. You are a lot better than Dad and I would want to be with you over him anytime.” Being better than Dad will certainly lift her spirits. I know it.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Really Kelly, you mean that?” She sits taller and hope forms in her voice. My words are working.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I hate Dad. We all hate Dad. He’s mean," I continue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You’re right.” She pauses to think and her eyes become distant, staring off. “I don’t know why he’s like that.” Then, her head drops with sorrow. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Uncertain what to say, I snuggle her for a hug while thinking of something that might make her laugh. She fastens her arms around me while continuing to cry. I will probably find a past story where we make fun of someone so hard that we laugh until we cry. But the story doesn’t matter. Whatever it takes to remain here in her arms, safe from the world. That’s what matters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once she was cheered up, she would say, “Oh Kelly, thank you for cheering me up. You’re my special girl and I don’t know what I would do without you. You know that? You really do love me.” It’s all of the words I labor to hear. Right here, the foundation of my worth being based on what I can do for others was solidifying. 										

										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>

										&emsp;&emsp;One time, Mom actually took all of us kids with her when she ran away from home after a particularly bad fight with Dad. I remember it being nighttime when she gathered us into the van. As she drove us down County Road 384, I was uncertain if we would ever see the trailer again. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I recall riding through the ghostly town in silence, only talking to calm Mom when she began to cry again. Occasionally, one of us grunted at the other for being crammed too closely in the seats. But, eventually, we stopped at a fast food joint and Mom ordered each of us a sandwich from the “dollar menu”. She parked at a rundown motel down the street so that we could eat our roast beef sandwiches in silence. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It was late into the night and we were all exhausted, so Mom headed into the motel to get us a room. When she returned, she plopped her head on the steering wheel and sobbed. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t have enough money, and they won’t let us stay. I told them that I have kids but they wouldn’t let us." Her voice trembled with hopelessness. “I guess we are going to sleep in here for tonight.” So, eight of us snuggled in to sleep as best we could in the overcrowded van.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know how the others felt at these times, but to me, it seemed as real as the impending apocalypse. It seemed that we were now embarking on a life without Dad and leaving everything we knew behind. One would think that I would see these impulsive acts as patterns of dysfunction from a mentally unstable person, but as a trusting child, I thought: this is it, we are never returning. I also lacked the knowledge of the amount of support and resources it takes for a single mom to leave an abusive relationship. I fell asleep, propped up against Sarah’s small body, with the certainty that I’d never see my home, pets or father again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When the sun lifted above the town, Mom knew Dad had left for work so she drove us home. Life would go on as normal. “God doesn’t believe in divorce. As a woman, I need to honor and respect your father. God would want me to forgive.” Whenever she said this, I was never sure if she was trying to convince us or herself.

									<h2><i>Egg Yolk and Blood</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad built our chicken coop with plywood and hex netting just beside a pond in the backyard. Because we never cleaned the coop, a thick coating of chicken droppings covered the ground inside, creating a foul stench of manure and swamp. Eventually, a build-up of excrement prevented the door from closing properly which allowed the chickens to escape with regularity. One day after I poured chicken feed into the trough, a rooster charged me and as I sprinted for the trailer, the chicken coop door snapped shut behind me--except because the door didn’t fully shut, the rooster was able to slip through and continue his charge. I swatted the food bucket aimlessly behind me and when I heard him moving in on me, I went for one last whack at him before reaching the trailer. He lurched through the air, landing on my back. When he slid off, his claws left a six-inch scratch gushing blood down my calf.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know if my dislike for chickens began following this incident, or the time when I found two of them dead with hundreds of maggots crawling from their bodies. Not only were the chickens uncompromising, but they were disgusting to me. Of all our pets, why did we have chickens? They woke us up way too early in the morning, didn’t snuggle and wanted nothing to do with us. Even so, my daily chore was caring for them.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One morning, I shivered my way across the frost-covered ground for the morning egg collection. Inside the chicken coop were four square roosting boxes filled with small mounds of hay. There were so many eggs laid that morning that when my plastic Neapolitan ice cream bucket was filled and there were still more to collect, I wondered if I had forgotten to do my chore the day prior. I paused to think of an easy solution. I could return to the house for another bucket, but that’s a long walk, so I searched the area for a similar container. Nothing. Determined to complete the task in one trip, I stack the extra ones on top.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Walking ever so carefully with the overflowing bucket of eggs, I eventually reached the kitchen refrigerator. Slowly, I moved a hand from the bucket to open the fridge. My breath caught as I watched a small white egg tumble and splatter onto the floor. From across the room, Dad witnessed the accident. My shame response was immediate: I’m so stupid. I knew I needed to make two trips, but I did not do that because I’m lazy. Gosh, I’m so stupid. Even at the young age of seven years old, Dad’s harsh narrative about me was engraved in my mind and had become my own internal dialogue.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I stood frozen in terror as he approached with a tight jaw and eyes that could destroy. He towered over me in anger. 
													<br>
													&emsp;&emsp;“You think it’s okay to drop eggs on my kitchen floor? You’re so lazy and stupid that you couldn’t use your brain to think for just a second! Huh? What are you, a retard?” His voice is mocking, but I’m too scared to listen so it becomes distant, as if coming through a thick fog. My face burns with humiliation and my throat stretches tight. I need to cry, but I don’t dare do it. Then, I hear his voice again. “You’re going to waste eggs?! I’ll show you not to waste eggs!” He grabs an egg from the bucket I’m still holding and smashes on top of my head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He snatches the bucket from my hands, shoves me, and commands “Now go take a shower!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I rush to the shower, unable to breathe from holding too many tears in. No, maybe it’s from holding too much fear in. Or, is it anger? I suppose maybe a bit of everything.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After I close the bathroom door, I release what I can in silent sobs. My chest is heavy with bricks and it’s impossible for air to enter. Each forced breath comes with more shaky, heavy and overwhelming tears. No matter how much I rinse and wash, my hair still feels coated in goopy egg yolk. I am left to figure out another problem with nobody around to guide me. When experiencing a traumatic event, the body's nervous system will commonly respond in one of four ways: by fighting the threat, freezing,  running away or a fawn response, in which the victim attempts to please an abuser to avoid conflict. My brain and body knew the safest option with dad was to freeze, but the threat would never truly be gone until I could disappear from his presence.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, I give up on my hair and collapse onto the floor of the tub, my limbs weak from trembling in fear.  Finally, at the end of the shower I regain my mental strength and think: I may be stupid, but at least now I know the secret ingredient to the world’s softest and shiniest hair. Somehow, I was creating a coping mechanism of finding the positive in even the most humiliating of circumstances.

										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;Not all of my experiences with Dad were painful. Mom always said that he did well with babies and younger kids. Once we got older, she explained, he didn’t know how to get along with us. Around the age of six, Dad and I had a connection. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Most mornings, upon waking, I heard the 1970s mellow song “I Feel the Earth Move” by Carole King coming from his record player. It was my favorite. Still dark outside, everyone would have still been sleeping but they wouldn’t have been asleep for long, as most days my siblings were up until the late hours of the night and did not wake until well into the afternoon.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I typically avoided the kitchen. It was where the mice scampered across the stove, through the pantry, and under the fridge. Sometimes they were found dead in the dirty dishes, unable to escape from the sink. Or, on one occasion, the inside of a pop can. But mornings with Dad made me untouchable to the mice. Being on his good side in those moments meant that his rage would be directed toward anything in the world but me. His aggression would be used to protect, not harm me. Is that how mom felt?
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;He had a tenderness about him--a softness that I only ever saw him have toward his own mother. Sometimes he discussed his music or army days but mostly, we enjoyed each other's presence in silence. Each morning he boiled a pot of water and added two cheap packages of chicken ramen noodles. As the noodles softened, he threw in slices from a brick of Velveeta cheese. I watched him intently, soaking up the enjoyment of him cooking me breakfast. At the table, he poured milk, which stained his light brown mustaches white as he sipped between bites. He flashed occasional smiles in my direction, not needing words to show he enjoyed my presence.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;After breakfast, he sat at the table lacing his steel-toe Timberland boots, wrapping the string around the boots multiple times.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Alright Kelly-girl, let’s get you back to bed.” It was still 5:30am and Mom would be asleep for a few more hours. When left awake, I inevitably got bored and woke my siblings. He knew that the best option for getting me back to sleep was with a quick goodbye kiss and leaving me to snuggle with Mom. Everything felt safe.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On the weekends, Dad let me spend more time with him. Saturday mornings we headed to the town dump just a quarter mile down County Road 384. We unloaded trash cans from the back of his truck into big metal containers. On days when the bins were full, big trucks came to empty them out. Life was chaotic, but the engines roaring and clanking noises from the dump on Saturday mornings were consistent.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But the dump wasn’t only for dropping off trash, it was also for finding treasures. K.J. 's wife, Martha, tells a traumatizing story of when Mom made her dinner at the trailer. Cramped at the kitchen table, she was in the middle of her meal when Mom exclaimed “Isn’t this turkey great! I found it down the street at the dump and just couldn’t believe that someone was throwing a whole turkey away!” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Martha finishes the story by asserting an uncomfortable “Uh, okay… not eating her food again.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I usually respond to such stories with an embarrassed eye roll and something like: “Ya, Gross. She’s crazy.” Thinking back, this makes me wonder how many of our meals came from the town dump. I laugh as these thoughts come, picturing Mom’s voice saying, “It's ok, It will just build your immune system.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Aside from dumping trash, Dad did other “manly” duties like yard work, hunting, or fixing machines. I enjoyed the rare occasion that he let me tag along when working on his truck at a friend's garage. It was quiet and he brought good food, like Subway sandwiches, for lunch. He enjoyed the calm and quiet with nothing more than the light sound of his radio streaming late 90s country music from the far end of the garage. Occasionally, he asked for a tool or told me about what he was doing.  But mostly, he became irritable when I talked so I watched in silence, learning to enjoy the stillness. I developed this skill so well that for many years, I became mute at the mere sign of male presence. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My favorite experiences with Dad were trips into our woods to cut firewood. He mostly did this in the fall so we wore orange hats and jackets, just in case any deer hunters had snuck onto our property. The roar of his chainsaw was loud, but I didn’t mind because the sweet smell of the freshly cut trees made up for it. I stared in astonishment as powdered tree shavings piled onto the ground, wondering how a machine so small could have enough power to cut an entire tree. Dad gave me instructions on where to stand and sit, which was usually in the back of the truck. He wanted to be sure that I was safe from any trees falling my way. I loved that Dad noticed such things and was diligent about keeping me safe. I followed every instruction, showing him how good I could be. Longing for him to be proud. Hoping to be perfect enough to never again trigger his anger.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes the trees needed a push to go in the right direction. “Tiiimmmbbbbeeeerrr!!!” Dad would shout through a laugh, then smile at me to share the enjoyment.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was in awe of him. He was smart and took the time to teach me things. One day, he went on a tangent about army days and how “you survive on what you can”.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, look here! Take some of these!” I looked at him curiously as he placed little red berries into my hand. Their colors were vibrant and they had a perfectly smooth roundness. I am certain he said the name of them, but the memory has slipped away from me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Look, try one!” he popped a handful into his mouth. “If you are ever stuck in the wilderness you need to know what is safe to eat, it’s these here, you can tell by the leaf!” He continued on his explanation, excited that I was interested.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When I ate them, I realized they didn’t have much flavor. It kind of reminded me of dull cardboard. And the texture was strange, they crumbled more than smooshed in my mouth. Regardless, I spent years playing imagination games where I was surviving off of little red berries in the wilderness.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Dad was done with the chainsaw, he placed big logs onto the tree stump and cut them smaller with an axe. From there, I was finally able to make myself useful by carrying pieces, one log at a time, to the truck. Being sure to stack them in the very specific rows that he had taught me. It was my special time with him and I felt extra proud when he trusted me to help. For those moments, I truly was daddy’s little girl. But moments were all they were. We would return to the trailer, his irritability would return and anyone might fall victim to his horrendous abuse. Even me.
										
										<br></p>
										~ 
										<p><br>
										
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Touching the Carpet” was my favorite childhood game. The object was to get from one destination to another without touching the carpet, which was lava. One day, when I was around the age of seven, Abe, Sarah, and I made the goal of getting from the boys' bedroom at one end of the trailer, to the kitchen located just after the hall and living room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I set to making my game plan. The hall would be the most difficult challenge, so I search the area, then collect toys and shoes that I can drop and step on as I go. Once I reach the living room, I will be out of supplies. “That’s okay, I’ll use the furniture!” I continue planning.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Except the living room furniture is more difficult to navigate than anticipated. I pause to think, knowing that I need a new plan. Ah, I’ll just follow Abe! I won’t come in first, but I won’t be last either!
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my right, Sarah moves along the couch, not noticing that there will be nothing to climb onto once she reaches the end. Abe heads for the chest of drawers, our peculiar television stand. After that obstacle, it will be a straight shot to the kitchen.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Climbing the chest of drawers is harder than I thought so I use Abe’s tactic of pulling the drawers open and hoisting myself up. My toes balance on top of the dresser and heels hang off the edge. I would have taken a different route had I known how little space was up here. As my feet slide toward the other end, my balance slips. When my left hand struggles to grasp the tv, the right goes for a metal object beside it--a TV aerial mounted onto the wall. Dad usually keeps it outside on the roof but for whatever reason, it is inside at this time. It doesn’t hold my weight, but it does provide what I need to regain balance. Abe has already made it back down and as I steady myself, the aerial falls, piercing the top of his head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The game is over. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I climb down the drawers and to his side. Blood is gushing from his puncture wound, his dark blonde hair is soaked with it. Mom suddenly appears from her bedroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Oh no! What happened!” she exclaims.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It was an accident. We were playing no touching carpet and the antenna fell. It was just an accident.” My voice is rushed, trying to emphasize that I did not hurt him intentionally.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kurt! I need you! Come help, quick!” Mom screams and runs to Abe’s side.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I stumble backwards, afraid of what Dad’s reaction will be.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He rushes from his bedroom, bringing the stench of beer with him. Rather than tending to the gaping wound, he turns his attention to me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Dammit Kelly! Why would you drop the antenna on his head like that for?!” His hands grasp my arm and shove me down face first onto the couch. I’m held frozen while he unlatches his leather belt. My limbs flail in efforts to escape as they anticipate the sting of the blow. The first one lands and my teeth clench. I yelp with the next one. And comes another. And another. The snap of the leather striking my bottom is excruciating. The sting worsens when he misses and thrashes my thighs or calves. Or worse, my back. Fear and pain overtake me, and I can no longer breathe through my clenched chest. I lose track of how many times he whips me, hoping each one will be the last. Everything hurts. I want him to understand that it was an accident. That I would never hurt Abe on purpose. I want him to know that I try hard to be a good kid. Instead, I’m left with the  hopelessness of  knowing that I can’t escape being in trouble. I can’t escape the pain.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Now get to your room and don’t come out until I say you can!” he shouts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Muscle memory guides me to the back bedroom. I can’t see through the tears. It’s the bedroom that would later become the boys’ room, but for now, it sleeps me, Abe, Chase, Sarah, Josiah, and Daniel. My bed is one of the small triple bunks that Dad had built onto the wall, but because I usually sleep on the couch or with Mom, it is filled with boxes of toys, clothes, and old blankets. Between not having a bed, and still not having permission to leave the room, I head for an open bunk bed at the other end of the room to fulfill my punishment. Who knows how long I will be in here. Sometimes Mom and Dad forget. When that happens, I call a sibling to the room, begging them to ask that I be let out. Other times, I wait for Dad to leave, then come out. But today, I imagine I will remain in this room until the next morning. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My legs and bottom are swollen, but numb. A child who knows abuse, knows that there is a point beyond the pain where there is no feeling. Instead, I work to regain my breath because air won’t fit through my chest. And my limbs shake with terror.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Still crying uncontrollably, I peek out the door, hoping that Mom will see and comfort me. Instead, I see Dad with his green metal army box that he keeps medical supplies in. Abe sits at the table crying while Dad works on his head. He is grunting about having to give him “stitches.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I close the door and return to the top bunk. My legs throb now. My bottom begins to sting. The ache in my head, throat, and chest make it impossible to stop crying. My mind conjures up images of  Mom hugging me until I can get calm again. She would tell me that it wasn’t my fault and that she knew it was an accident. It would be followed by her apologizing for Dad being mean to me. But Dad would never know. That’s what she usually did. But on this night, when I need it most, no one comes. I curl into a ball until the tears rock me to sleep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;That night would create a family story that always began with “remember that time when Kelly cracked Abe’s head open?” Everyone would laugh and breathe sighs of relief that he was okay while he touched his scar in remembrance. No one acknowledged that it wasn’t intentional. No one recalled the beating I received from playing a silly game. Such whippings were never mentioned because all of us children suffered so many--and for reasons far more unjust.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was like the dogs when they did something triggering such immense anger in Dad that he attacked them. When he finished, they whimpered, limped, made themselves small, and hid. None of us were brave enough to acknowledge the injustice and comfort them. The moment it was over, we coped by pretending it never existed at all.

									<h3>
										Animals III - German Shepherds
									</h3>
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;We always owned at least one purebred German Shepherd. “These are guard dogs. They will protect you and take down any bad guy who tries to hurt you," Dad assured us regularly.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;He launched into a story to prove his point. One of  Dad’s friends commented on the nice temperament of our dog, Buck. “I told him that Buck was a guard dog and would protect anyone who lives here if someone tried to hurt us but he didn’t believe me. So I said, ‘you pretend to attack me and I guarantee he will protect me,’” Dad’s voice was loud and harsh with a mocking tone. It was the tone that he used to show that someone was, as he would say, a “retard”.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;“Sure enough, he put his arms up like he was going to hurt me and Buck put a hole right into his stomach.” By this part of the story, his hoarse smoker's voice was laughing with satisfaction. He had proven his point.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Given how much Dad beat the dogs, I didn’t understand why they protected him. He raged on the gentle creatures for simple things like getting in his way, eating out of the trash, or having a rare potty accident in the house. His method of training was to attack and show them who was in control. “That is how you earn their respect," Dad explained to us. But what I saw was a lack of control all around. Something would snap in Dad. His eyes became dark and before anyone could blink, the dogs would be pinned down, choked, and beaten. Their pitiful whimpers didn’t stop him. He only released when the rage passed. The moment he did, they cowered, wet themselves, and hid, just like us kids. Dad would then move on as if nothing had happened, often looking confused as to why people and animals feared him.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;The dog's loyalty compared to Mom’s never-ending forgiveness of Dad. Whether they protected him in hopes of earning his respect or out of fear--or because they genuinely loved him--was uncertain. Maybe it was a mixture of all. My guess is that it was survival. Follow the instruction to avoid the abuse.

											</p>
											~ 
											<p><br>
											
											&emsp;&emsp;Our dogs died for numerous reasons. The first one, Sasha, had been one of my favorites. Dad had been struggling to get along with our neighbors which was not uncommon, as his temper impacted many of his relationships. One night he burst through the back door. He was furious. Attempting to control his emotions, he rubbed his hand through his brown curly hair while pacing the living room. 
												<br>
												&emsp;&emsp;“The dog’s dead. That retard neighbor poisoned her. I found her lying dead on that side of the house.” He pointed toward the direction of his and Mom’s bedroom.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;My body shook as I attempted to wrap my mind around how the dog was dead and worse, that she had been poisoned! I did not know if I was more afraid of the dog's death, Dad’s anger, or the neighbor who he was convinced had killed her. Whatever the cause, it was to my dismay that Sasha had indeed been found dead outside.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;She was replaced with another German Shepherd dog, Lady, who later birthed purebred puppies. Being the runt of the litter, our new family favorite pup, Max, appeared much smaller than any German Shepherd I had ever seen. Intelligence made up for his small stature, making him a wonderfully calm and well-trained pet. Most of my family avoided the animals, as they all had serious infestations of fleas. I figured that the house was infested anyway, so I didn’t see the difference. Snuggling with him on the floor became my favorite pastime. Besides, the flea bites left only small red marks on my body, unlike Mom, who they seemed to torture relentlessly.
												<br>
												&emsp;&emsp;One day, Max was hit by a car, leaving his back leg broken. Searching for a solution, Dad headed to Menard’s, the local hardware store, to buy materials for making a cast. Max appeared miserable attempting to walk with a bulky homemade cast on his leg.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Efforts to heal it with a cast failed, as Max inevitably found ways to chew it off. “That’s it, he can’t continue living in pain like this.” Irritated, Dad went to his safe and retrieved a gun.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Sarah and I concocted a solution. Vet expenses were too high, but what about a cone to stop him from chewing the cast? Neither of us mustered the bravery to share our ideas with Dad.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;“Stay inside, I have to go take care of Max.” Dad hurried through the living room with his pistol.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t dare move.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Staring at the door from the living room, time froze when the gunshot rang through the air.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;By the time I gathered the nerve to go outside, Dad was moving Max, who was wearing a plastic grocery bag over his head. “If you get them right in the temple it is a quick death. They die before they even know what has happened," Dad attempted to reassure us. Puddles of blood bubbled in the dirt. 
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;In some ways, knowing his death was quick did provide reassurance. In other ways, I grappled with another meaningless death due to my parents’ failure to take care of their pets’ basic needs. Some creatures, it seems, aren’t worthy of protecting--no matter how loved or loyal they are. I would soon learn to never take a moment with loved ones for granted, while the fear of what might happen without their presence settled in my soul’s core.

									<h2><i>Grandma Reed</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;Holidays were another reminder of how different our family was from the rest of the world. Halloween was satanic, so evil that I genuinely feared it. Not celebrating a holiday with pagan roots made sense in some of our church circles. But not celebrating Christian holidays like Easter and Christmas solicited strange looks--even from our conservative community. Mom thought that Easter idolized the bunny too much, rather than focusing on the Resurrection. She explained that we didn’t celebrate Christmas because of its pagan roots. “Besides,” she would say, “we don’t truly even know when Jesus was born anyway.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know if I felt more embarrassed or confused about not partaking in the typical children’s activities such as shopping for gifts, dying Easter Eggs, or getting pictures with Santa. We didn’t even attend Sunday services on days when Easter or Christmas sermons were planned. On rare occasions, I talked Mom into letting me attend Kibby Church’s Wednesday night youth group. But she only agreed because I promised that I wouldn’t partake in anything related to the Easter Bunny or Christmas.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Keeping my promise while participating with my friends required creativity. When we decorated Christmas cookies, I chose the snowman one. “It resembles winter, not Christmas," I assured Mom. If we did an art activity, I made mine about snowflakes. Easter was more difficult and I found myself sitting out of many Easter egg hunts. Fortunately, my friends were patient with me, sharing candy of their own.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“So, why don’t you celebrate Jesus’ birth or resurrection?” They were genuinely as confused as I was.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know, my Mom just thinks they are satanic or something like that. I don’t know, she’s weird like that.” Each time someone asked, my jaw tightened and blood flooded my cheeks. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dad disagreed with Mom on Christmas. And although her views were strong, she was more afraid of Dad. So when he took us to Grandma Reeds’ home each Christmas, she stayed silent.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he could afford it, he even bought us gifts of his own. Before going to Grandma Reed’ we enthusiastically unwrapped new sleds, board games, and clothing. “Remember, we don’t celebrate Christmas. This is just something nice that your dad wanted to do for you," Mom reminded us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But the gifts were often followed by Dad’s “Merry Christmas, you guys!” His smile was genuine on days when visiting Grandma was in our schedule. He adored her like no one else.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But, Mom didn’t like Grandma Reed. “She acts like she is better than everyone else,” she’d complain. “And we always have to go visit her. She can never drive thirty minutes to see her own grandkids. If she cares about you guys, she will have to come here to visit.” Because of this, we saw her twice a year: at my Uncle Chad’s on Thanksgiving and a month later at her house on Christmas Day. Mom rarely came to her Christmas celebrations. Instead, she passed up yet another opportunity of spending time with her kids to be alone in prayer. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t understand Mom’s dislike for Grandma Reed because I loved her just as dearly as Dad did. Each year when we arrived, she greeted us with big smiles, hugs and kisses. When she made it to me she would squeeze my cheeks and exclaim “you still have those beautiful dimples!” The pinching hurt, but it didn’t matter because it was Grandma.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My father’s father, Grandpa Cole, died many years before I was born. What little I know about him was from Mom. “He was not a nice man. I really think he was pretty physically abusive to your dad and his brothers," she would explain with pity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sometime after he died, Grandma married Grandpa Reed. Mom didn’t like him either. “He doesn’t like kids and is just rude," she would mutter every time we went over there. I felt confused by this because as a young girl, I felt perfectly comfortable around him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In my younger years, Grandma took us straight to the basement where we rode scooters on the concrete floor and played “Pin the Tail on the Donkey”. I was so young when Grandpa Reed died that I barely remember him, but I clearly remember Mom informing us of his death because it became a joke around our trailer. “Kids, your Grandpa Reed died. It actually sounds like he had a heart attack while he was on the toilet.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One of my brothers laughed, “Wait, he died on the toilet?!” His amusement was so contagious that the rest of us joined in the laughter.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya, I guess he did technically die on the toilet!” Mom burst into giggles along with us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After his death, we were never allowed into Grandma’s basement again but I was never sure why. I always wondered if that was where she kept his special belongings. Instead, we spent the holiday in her living room. Her house was outdated. The furniture and appliances looked like they hadn’t been changed out since the 1960s or 1970s. Yet somehow, they were so well maintained that they still looked new. The warm home smelled of green bean casserole, bread rolls, and my favorite, baked beans. Knowing how many I would eat, Grandma always made extra. I would eat firsts, seconds, thirds, and even fourths on baked beans. Even with my stuffed tummy, she would continue piling more servings on my plate. “You’re not full already, are you?! I made extra knowin

									<h3>
										Animals IV - Opossum
									</h3>
									
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;Josiah and his friend, Aiden, once brought home a baby opossum. They found it on the side of the road, just after discovering its mother's carcass. We took it in, fed it, and nursed it back to health. I quickly became attached to the little grey fur ball with a funny pink nose. I observed how its tiny body fit into the palm of my hand and loved how its favorite position was twirling its tail around my finger and hanging from it. Opossums were supposed to be vicious, but I was sure that it would be my gentle forever friend. 
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;As it grew, it became more active and one night slipped through the bars of its cage. We found its lifeless body under the couch cushion where Abe slept. My heart was crushed to lose my new little friend. I never learned how it died, and I would never learn if I could tame a wild opossum. I did discover that some animals who escape from their cages don’t escape suffering.

									<h2><i>Kelly’s Hero</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;One night, shortly after losing my first tooth, Mom and Dad decided on a last minute camping trip “up north”. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, go grab nightgowns and extra underwear.” Mom’s voice is hurried as she sits on the living room floor shoving clothes into a big black trash bag. I scan the space in confusion, leaving for a camping trip at night time feels abnormal--even to a small child.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Right now?” My voice is heavy, tired.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, quickly! We have to go fast if we do not want to get there too late.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;We squeeze into the van and hit the road.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Hours later I wake in a van weaving down a dirt road lined with trees. Darkness makes it difficult to see anything beyond the front headlights. Finally, we arrive at the campsite. There is nothing but shadows and trees in sight; we are alone in the forest. Dad’s camping lanterns light the air while he configures our enormous tent. My tired body is pacing the earth. I’m impatient, desperate for rest.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When morning breaks, I wake in our three-roomed canvas tent. In the room on my right Mom, Dad, and baby Avalon sleep on a luxurious air mattress while the rest of us are cushioned by sleeping bags. Sarah, Daniel and I share the middle room, leaving Josiah, Chase, and Abe crammed into the left.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I lie stiff as a board, needing to use the toilet, but debating whether it is worth the wrath of waking everyone. It’s always me needing to pee before everyone else. I try waiting for someone else to wake up, that way I won’t be the first to stir the crowd. But inevitably, it takes too long.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom,” I whisper, finally gaining the courage. “I have to go to the bathroom.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Loud groans from my siblings erupt as my voice wakes them. Some form of “Be quiet! We are trying to sleep!” shoots from every direction.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Does anyone else have to go? If so, you should go now so that we don’t have to make two trips.” Mom doesn’t whisper.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Some join us and others complain as we maneuver our way from the tent. We are indeed surrounded by trees, but it is not the campsite that I remember from the night before. Instead, across a dirt path, there is a sandy beach and lake right in front of us. A couple hundred feet down the path, are other campers. Mom grabs the toilet seat that we bring for camping trips, and directs us deep into the woods behind our tent. After digging a hole, she places the seat on top and hands me a roll of toilet paper. “Alright, now you go and I’ll turn around to keep watch. Then we will switch and you can keep watch for me.” She explains as I use our makeshift porta-a-potty.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When afternoon rolls in, Mom instructs us to put on our swimsuits. My tummy flutters with excitement as I slip into my hot pink one piece swimsuit with a cover up. The sunny air is warm, making it the perfect swim weather. Sitting on the tiny beach I scoop sun-soaked sand into my hands and let it fall onto my legs, relaxing in its warmth. Eventually, sweat makes me sticky and uncomfortable enough to join my siblings in the water.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, come swim with us!” my brothers shout. We love the rare occasion that Mom spends time with us. A united cheer breaks out when, at last, their persistence pays off. She enters the water, swimsuit cover-up still on to ensure modesty and her long black hair pulled back into a tight braid.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Will you go out into the deep water with me?” Josiah begs. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Mom, stay and play with me!” I plead, suddenly feeling in competition over her attention.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom responds, “I am going out with Josiah, but you can walk with us until the water gets up to your chest. Okay?” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Satisfied, my little legs prance underwater in efforts to keep up with them.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Okay Kelly, this is far enough. I am going to go out with Josiah. You stay and wait here. Do not go any farther.” Still too young to swim, she knows that deep waters aren’t safe for me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“But can’t you carry me? Please Mom! I want to come with you!” I whine, not wanting her to leave my side.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Kelly, I will be back in just a few minutes. Wait here, okay?” She pauses, then continues, “There is a drop-off in the sand just up here so you need to stay where you are.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I watch in disappointment as their figures become smaller with each step. Desperate to keep as close as I can, I inch forward, curious how far I can go into the water while still touching.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Suddenly, the tips of my toes abruptly skid downward and I’ve lost ground. It’s the drop-off Mom had warned me about. My feet kick, wildly searching for the lost bottom. I’m panicking. I fight to remain above water, but my head sinks. Then, I reach the surface, flailing relentlessly only to sink again. One more peak above water and the words screech violently, “Mom, HELP!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Her eyes widen with shock as she turns around. “Josiah, go get her! Quickly! Go, go, go! Go get her!” she shoves his arm and dives into a swim. I see their small bodies, so far away. Then, I’m down again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My body is losing the fight, so desperate for breath that it inhales the water. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Finally, firm hands settled underneath my back and I’m carried to air. It’s Josiah. I want to breathe, but I can’t. Finally, my chest lets out loud uncontrollable coughs. My shaking arms grasp his neck tightly, not daring to let go.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you okay?” he asks, setting me down in shallow water.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Tears fall from my face. I want comfort but fear and lack of breath are so big that words cannot form.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Just then, Mom approaches, making sure I am awake and breathing. “You almost drowned! I told you not to go any farther and that there was a drop off! What happened?!” She is concerned and hugs me. When she lets go, I hold on tighter. “I am so glad I saw you! Josiah saved your life. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Just stay here and don’t go out deep again or you’ll drown.” Josiah's voice is serious, yet caring.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom pries my hands from her, and I head for the shore, needing to be free from the lake that nearly swallowed me whole. My windpipe burns and I continue coughing water droplets. I want to cry until Mom comforts me, but my brothers will find that annoying. So, sitting back down in the sand, I hug my legs tightly to my chest. My heart is pounding, but I didn’t drown.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;For years to come, Mom spoke of the day in which Josiah saved me from drowning. “Josiah saved you!” Then, she would look at my siblings, “Do you guys remember that?! Kelly’s hero. You might not be alive and here with us if it wasn’t for him. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah. The reason I lived. 
										<br>
										~
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Glen was a middle aged man who lived a mile up the street, the opposite direction from the Maple Grove Tavern. He could usually be found wearing a filthy flannel shirt and ripped blue jeans. I knew from the smell of alcohol, cigarettes and musty sweat, that he hadn’t showered in days--or even weeks.  His body appeared worn-down and aged-old, maybe from his negligent lifestyle or addiction to substances. The setup of his trailer was similar to ours, except more stinky. The scent of stale smoke loomed in the air. It wasn’t cluttered like ours, but had extra grime.  Eventually, he would move into an old camper on his Mom’s property across the street. But during most of my memories of him, he dwelled in the trailer. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Glen grossed me out. His appearance was rough, but he also gave a “vibe” that made me nauseated. Maybe my stomach was reacting to the stench, but his character was suspicious. Even though I was a small child, he seemed too interested in our family and wandered onto our property multiple times per day. Sometimes he walked from the street, other times he stumbled out of our backwoods. Mostly, he drove his little rusty red car that reeked of cigarette smoke and always swayed to our front door while gripping a brown paper bag with liquor tucked inside. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	At the trailer, he talked to my mom and brothers separately for hours. No one was interested in socializing with him, but he lingered anyway. Mom was the most sympathetic toward him.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	One day, when I was around the age of seven, he and Mom were talking outside of the trailer. He had brought his daughter, Jenny, and son, Charlie, who were off playing with my brothers in the yard. “You should send’em boys over for pizza night. For my famous pizzas they like.” His words slurred.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Really? Ya. Ya. I bet they would like that.” Mom nodded in agreement.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“They can even stay the night so you don’t have to worry about it getting late," he continues.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“That’s so nice of you to do that. Really, it is. I bet they will love that and have so much fun.” As a mother of nine it could be difficult for mom to find a break for herself, so she jumped at the offers of someone wanting to help with the kids. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	When Mom closed the door, I begged. “Mom, can I go, too? Please!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah, Chase, and Abe went to Glen's for his famous pizza nights regularly throughout the years. My brothers often talked of the fun they had over there learning to make homemade pizza and adventuring in the woods. I felt left out of this fun event and wished to be included.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“No, you have to stay here," Mom instructed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	But I persisted. “Why Mom? I really want to go? Please can I go!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Because you weren’t invited. It’s a bunch of boys anyway. It is not good to have girls stay over with boys like that. They are having a boys night," she insisted. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom rarely let me stay at friends’ houses if they had boys. She was worried we might get crushes on each other and wanted to protect me from that. She was also fearful of  boys coming onto me and touching me in ways that they shouldn’t. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You have a beautiful body Kelly. The boys are going to love it. That is why you have to stay modest and never be alone with a boy. Otherwise they will take advantage of you.” I imagine that she never considered the possibility of  someone taking advantage of her boys. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“But Janette is a girl! I can just play with her!” I begged.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Nope. I said no, and that’s final. And if you keep asking then you are going to get a spanking.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the time I wondered if she actually worried about what might happen to me over there, or if she just didn’t think my brothers would want their little sister tagging along. Regardless, I am now  thankful she shielded me from the experience.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My brothers, mainly Abe and Josiah, picked up on my begging to go to Glen's and saw it as an opportunity. One day, on a drive to Friday school, where homeschool gatherings were held, they pestered me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“She just wants to go to Glen's because she has a crush on Charlie," Josiah starts.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I do not!” I scream. I don’t even know what a crush is. I just know that when people have one they want to kiss and hold hands. I do not want that. Charlie is funny, but grosses me out because he smells nearly as bad as his dad. Even if he didn’t smell, kissing is gross.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Abe teases, “See how you’re overreacting? That proves that you have a crush on him.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, I don’t!” My face burns with rage and humiliation.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, you do, we saw the way that you were looking at him today," Abe continues, amused.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Looking at him how? I was just normal!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, you weren’t, you had the eyes. The ones that say you have a crush on him.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When this happened, the teasing would continue until I would scream loud enough for Mom to step in. If she intervened, she took whatever side she was in the mood for that day. When she wasn’t around, I screamed and ran away where I then withdrew into myself. Them treating me like this made me question my own reality. Did I have a crush that I wasn’t aware of? What actually was a crush? What had I been doing with my eyes? I felt vulnerable, like I had sinned without knowing it. But my brothers saw. If I didn’t understand what I did wrong, I didn’t know how to fix it. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A couple of years later, Mom and Dad got into a monstrous argument over Glen. It was the middle of the night and the trailer was dark. They never cared who heard their screaming matches, but they were so upset this time that they didn’t notice me sitting on the raggedy brown carpet next to the couch watching the heated row. Something bad had happened, but I didn’t understand what.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“I told you he is a pedophile! That man is no good and deserves to burn in hell!” Dad is so close to Mom that spit shoots like venom at her face.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“I don’t know what you want me to do Kurt! I felt bad for him! He has no one and I was just trying to love him like God would want! And God would want us to forgive him! He has had such a rough life. We just need to pray for him that God will change his heart.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“He is into touching little boys! He is sick and disgusting. How dare you let our kids go over there!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom begins to cry. “Well, they’re your kids too so how about you parent them for a change! I never do anything right. I’ll never be good enough. I might as well be better off dead.” She’s regressing back into the victim role again rather than taking accountability for her lapse in judgment. Or is it hopelessness that she’s feeling? Hopelessness for failing to keep her children safe and experiencing a lack of support from her husband. I would see these responses from her many times in my life. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I don’t remember anything else from that night, but I think Glen came over less after that. When he did, it was only when Dad was gone. I hope that the extravagant pizza nights stopped at that time, but the memories are lost on me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my knowledge, Glen's abuse toward my brothers was never discussed again. It was swept under the rug, as if it never happened. But, I can scarcely imagine the pain it caused my brothers to not only have their abuse not acknowledged, but to have the person who sexually violated them discussed as a person needing love and forgiveness--all to model God’s love.

									<h3>
										Animals V - Bunnies
									</h3>
									
									<p>
										<i>
											&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes animals wandered into our lives as strays but most of the time, we purchased them. Such was the case with our bunnies. Each summer our family went to a place called “Deer Forest” where we interacted with different farm animals. We fed deer, went on camel rides, played miniature golf, rode a Ferris wheel and traveled on a small train. A Deer Forest favorite was picking out our favorite bunnies when they sold them at the end of the summer.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;	“Please Mom, can we pick out bunnies to take home!” we pleaded. At first, Mom gave a strict “no”, but we always managed to change her mind with enough nagging.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;	“Okay guys, but it’s going to be your responsibility to feed and take care of them. Okay? Do we have a deal?” she bargained. This was a common trick for her. Once the responsibility was put on us, there was no further instruction or accountability from her. On the rare occasion she remembered, we received prompts to feed them, but beyond that, we were held liable should anything go wrong. Thinking back, I realized that Mom often agreed to things in the moment to avoid negative emotions without thinking of future consequences.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;My favorite bunny was pure white, so naturally, I named her Snowball. That winter Abe’s chore was to feed and water the rabbits.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;One morning, Abe rushed through the trailer door. “Come here! Fast! I have to show you something!” His voice was rushed. When we arrived at the shed that the bunnies cages were in, he pointed to Snowball. A bowl of solid ice sat in her cage. Next to it, she was lying stiff frozen. Abe at first appeared concerned, but quickly pushed his feelings aside and instead, took on an air of indifference.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Anger toward Abe shot through my veins. I wanted to scream at him, but knew that her death was most likely from the cold rather than lack of food. Or, what I would later realize, lack of appropriate shelter to keep the domesticated bunnies warm. It was an instance in which Mom hadn’t reasoned through what else they might need to survive beyond trusting children to feed and water them. I imagine Mom falling into this same trap when deciding to have nine children. She made a decision based on what she wanted at the moment, without properly thinking about how to afford or care for so many people on such a low household income. In addition, she didn’t recognize that so many people wouldn’t fit into a small trailer. This failure to plan meant there was no means or support to create the structured and healthy environment that children need. We were no better off than the bunnies.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;But as a young girl, I felt an overwhelming guilt for not making it a priority to check on Snowball more often. Mom would provide hugs for comfort but ultimately remind me that the responsibility had been on us kids to take proper care of the animals. Not only did she put too much responsibility on us, she failed to provide effective resources and education for keeping the animals healthy. We were set up to fail. But if anyone dare speak of the injustices, she reverted to her victim state, reminding us that we “made” her buy the animals and that actually, we “owed” her for doing a kind deed. What seemed to be acts of kindness were actually strings being tied tightly around us as means of control and for the animals it always seemed to end in suffering or death. 
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;The next year, we were sure to not make the same mistake with the bunnies. Amazingly, our beautiful all black bunny, Midnight, lived longer than any of our other animals. Shortly after getting her, she had babies of her own that also became our pets. Together, they made their home burrowed under our shed. We soon learned that this provided them with warmth during harsh winters, and safety from getting eaten by the dogs.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;The bunnies living cage-free meant that we could not pick them up whenever we wanted. Trust would have to be earned. Abe, Sarah, and I spent hours each day luring them out with carrots. From Abe we learned that carrots were good for eyesight. Searching Midnight’s eyes, I felt pleased knowing that she would have the best eyesight in the world given the amount of carrot feedings she was getting. I even stole some bites for myself, knowing that I wanted the same strong eyes.
											<br>
											&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, at age eleven, it came time for us to move from our little trailer on County Road 384. “The bunnies have to stay. There is not enough yard at the new house for them," Mom explained. The domesticated bunnies stayed behind. She abandoned them, forcing them to learn to survive in unfamiliar territory.

									<h2><i>Josiah in Charge</i></h2>
									<br>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;When away from home, Mom always assigned the eldest kid as a babysitter. Because K.J. and Jacob moved out when I was so young, I mostly remember it being Josiah. Sometimes she was “leaving” Dad, other times she was grocery shopping or cleaning rental houses. On this particular day, Mom was running errands.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Okay Kelly, you fold laundry and Josiah you will be doing dishes...” Mom continues down the list. Typically I would beg to go with her, but she has already told me “no” because of chores.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Everyone begins their work prior to her leaving. Then as soon as the door closes, Josiah drops the dish towel and walks toward the living room. “Okay Kelly, go do the dishes.” He is calm, playing out a normal routine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“What?! No! Mom said that was your chore.” I hate when he bosses me around.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Ya but she’s gone and left me in charge. And I’m telling you to do them.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“That’s not fair!” My voice shrieks.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ya it is. I’m your elder so you have to do what I say.” These were words that Mom drilled into all of us.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No. I’m not doing them.” I start to walk away.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What did you just say to me?” His teeth are now clenched.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Suddenly, I am aware of how small I am. But I refuse to lose to him. I try to maintain eye contact. “I said I’m not doing them. Mom told you to.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He grabs my wrist and digs his nails deep.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I said. Go. Do. The. Dishes.” His teeth remain clenched while he speaks, and his movements are calculated. He recognizes his power, and his venomous eyes pierce me to the bone.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah stop! You’re hurting me!” I try to pry his fingers off with my other hand. They are too tight.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Are you going to do the dishes?” He is unwavering and not to be questioned. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But I can’t give in. I can’t show weakness. “No! I’m not doing your dishes!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;A grin forms on his face, finding amusement in my lack of control. Then he reaches behind my head and yanks my hair so hard that I wonder if it rips from my scalp.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop you’re hurting me!” I yelp.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I. Said. Go. Do. The. Dishes.” His anger is increasing.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Now I’m scared. I don’t want to be hurt so it’s easier to give in. “Fine, I’ll do the dishes! Just let go. Please Josiah!” Now, I’m pleading.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He releases me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I’m telling Mom on you though!” I shout while running the opposite direction.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As I storm from the room I hear, “So what? Do it. She won’t believe you anyway.” He lets out a chuckle as he walks to the computer on the other end of the room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Dirty dishes line the counters and spread across the kitchen table. Completing this chore feels endless. And, the smell of old food and mildew fills the air making me gag. So, I don’t do them. Instead, I fold baskets of laundry. Josiah is still at the computer when I return to the living room. I am unsure where my siblings are, probably off at friends’ houses, playing outside, or in their bedrooms.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, come here.” Josiah turns to me with a gentle smile. I see the computer screen. It’s what Josiah calls “porn”--something he shows me when he wants to touch me again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Usually, they are videos of men and women engaging in sexual encounters. Other times, it’s two women. One of them will have a fake penis attached to the front of what looks like a belt. I’m confused by this. I had never thought about how women had sex before, but I guess this makes sense.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No Josiah, I don’t want to.” Humiliated, I search the area for anyone who might overhear what is happening.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Common’, Kelly, I know you want to. You’re just not in the mood yet.” He approaches me, blue eyes hungry with lust and begins touching in a way that elicits a response. No matter how much I fight it, my body always betrays me with a response of pleasure.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After that, comes shame and disgust. I will run as far away from him as I can get, hoping to disappear all together.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;These events happen whenever Mom isn’t home, or even sometimes if she’s busy in the other room. Which is at least daily. Sometimes he even has me take baths with him or do unthinkable things in the hot-tub. I do what I can to avoid his presence, especially when Mom isn’t home. But hunting is his art and he pounces at any opportunity, excited to devour his prey.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When Mom arrives home, I tattle-tell about the dishes, not what Josiah did to me in the back bedroom just moments before. Long ago he explained to me that we would both get into trouble, and since then silence about it has become an unspoken rule. I also work hard to hide it, hoping to bury the embarrassment I feel. It doesn’t make sense to me at the time, I just feel disgusted with myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, Josiah tried to make me do his dishes while you were gone! And when I said no he scratched me and pulled my hair! See, there’s marks all over my wrist!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Josiah, did you do that?” Mom tries to act serious, but we can all tell she doesn’t mean it. She’s tired. These occurrences happen regularly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Well, she disobeyed me," he responds with confidence.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, did you disobey him?” Her attention is back on me. It feels like a game. One that I don’t know how to win.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Well, ya, because the dishes were his chore!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“And she was disrespectful and got an attitude with me," he chimes in.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! No, I didn’t! He was being mean to me!” I’m losing control of my temper again.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, she yelled at me. Just like she’s doing now," he counters.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! No, Mom, you have to believe me! I only yelled because he was hurting me!” I want someone to understand the boiling rage in me. There is so much emotion, but I don't scream to hurt anyone or be “bad.” It is too much emotion so I explode. That’s all I know.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;But Josiah, what he does is intentional, tactical, and effortless. It makes my rage boil more.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Yet, no matter my efforts, I can’t make Mom believe me. The lack of knowing what to do or how to save myself from the inevitable makes my head spin so fast that I’m losing control all over again. So I scream. I scream loud because it’s what my body needs to do. Then, I feel guilty and embarrassed for screaming. It’s all wrong. Everything is wrong. And scary. And when mom’s not on my side, I’m alone. Alone with no safe space to turn to. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“See how she’s overreacting, that proves that she’s lying. She did get an attitude with me.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I did not! You were hurting me!” No matter how loudly I scream, Mom won’t hear.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Well, Kelly, Josiah is your elder and I did leave him in charge. You disobeyed him.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What, no I didn’t! Mom, it’s not fair! I folded the laundry like you said!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah smirks at me from behind her, satisfied with his victory.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I truly hate him. My muscles tighten with fury but don’t know what to do with it and the powerful emotions are paralyzing. I don’t understand how he could be so nice to me one second and horrendous the next. He enjoys my body, but everything beyond that is meaningless. What makes me feel disgusted with myself, is the only thing that makes him be nice to me. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I am even more confused by Mom. How can she take his side when such injustice is occurring? Why do I get punished when he was the one bullying me? Why doesn’t she believe me? It is no wonder that I don’t tell her what he truly does to me while she’s gone: between his threats and her siding with the older sibling and never believing me, I am certain I would have been paddled for his abuse of me. Even worse, she would have roped Dad in for the belt. After, I would have been sent to my room to repent for my sinful behavior of lying or enticing my brother. Or possibly she would do the same thing that she did with Glen: forgive and forget Josiah and turn a blind eye. I was trapped into a lose-lose-lose situation. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;There were times when Mom didn’t always take his side. She was quite unpredictable, making it difficult to know whose side she would choose. Maybe it was who had the better argument. Or maybe it depended on her mood that day. If Josiah had gotten into trouble with Dad recently, she might feel bad for him and take his side no matter what. The same would go for me. It all just depended on feelings and circumstances.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This time, I was the target on the other end of the kitchen paddle.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What, no Mom, please! I didn’t do anything wrong!” I start to run, but remember it’s better if I don’t. Escaping Mom is easy, but then I would get the belt from Dad when he gets home. So instead, I surrender, because the spatula by Mom is a simple sting compared to the thrashing of Dad’s leather belt. Either way, this ends with fresh marks on my bottom to add to the wounds from Josiah on my wrists.   
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;~
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah did many things to taunt me like older brothers do, but his taunts were especially cruel. He always delighted when triggering an emotional response. Once when he was in charge, I was famished. We were low on food and I didn’t know how to use the stove.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah, can you make me some ramen noodles? I’m hungry," I beg until he gives in.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;He has just drained the noodles from the boiling water when he looks at me with an idea. “Want to see me stick a noodle down my throat and pull it back up?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No!” I exclaim, irritated by his torment.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Watch, I can really do it!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Josiah! Please don’t! I’m begging you! Please!” I squirm in my chair, wanting to leap and scratch his face until he stops. But he’s too strong and will only hurt me. I know that, so I remain seated, unable to follow through.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Watch.” He stares while lowering the noodle into his mouth. When he pulls it out, he places it back into the pot of noodles. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Josiah! I hate you! Why would you do that?” My throat aches from shouting. Tears fill my eyes.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“It’s fine," he chuckles. “We share DNA anyway.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he places the bowl of noodles in front of me, I no longer feel hunger, just revulsion. He turns his head and I pour them into the trash.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I thought that he was being “nice” during the sexual abuse, because at least he wasn’t taunting me like with the noodles or pestering or the countless other ways he tormented me over the years. He spoke kindly and used gentle hands when he molested me. He didn’t threaten me and made it seem as if it were a form of play. In retrospect, he was more kind to me during moments of sexual abuse than anyone was in my entire life. Everything felt so confusing.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As a little girl, I didn’t understand that the sexual encounters were abuse--that all of his actions were being used as a way to overpower someone smaller than him. He was so powerless over his own abuser, Glen, that he taunted me and controlled my body to regain some semblance of agency over his life. I wasn’t a person to him; I was just something that filled a deep hole of pain. Yet, I felt like I was something to him. Because he paid attention to me. He was nice. It’s so sad to think back on how the person who showed me the most love, was Josiah, my abuser. I deserved so much more. I deserved better. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;~
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	By the age of six, the sexual encounters with Josiah were already so normal that I began asking questions out of curiosity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Why does it feel good?” I was confused.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know, it just does.” At first, he enjoyed my curiosity.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Does it feel good in the butt?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Uhm, no.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Why not?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know. It just doesn’t.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Then, my questions became more annoying and difficult to answer. “Why isn’t anyone supposed to know?”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Because we will get into trouble” was his usual response.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As the abuse continued through the years, I hated myself more. I felt naked the moment anyone’s eyes landed on me. But nothing left me more exposed than when he saw me. Despite Josiah's answers to my questions, I still felt confused. What felt certain was that if it had to be kept this big of a secret, there must be something terribly wrong with what we were doing. I say “we” because as a kid, I felt like a participant, not a victim. He badgered me, but rarely forced me into sexual encounters. Like most abusers, he was more kind and attentive than ever during the sexual abuse. I never once thought he was the one hurting me. Instead, I felt that together, we were doing something wrong. That I was just as responsible as him, if not more. Because I was the one who still gave in knowing how wrong it must be.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One time, as he pestered me, I challenged him: “I bet my friends don’t do it!” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, they all do. Everyone does. They just don’t talk about it.” He rolls his eyes in annoyance.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Does Kathy Brown do it?” I ask this because Mom has been comparing me to Kathy Brown, insisting that I be more like her. “Kathy Brown  is so nice and respectful, why can’t you be more like her? She would never talk back to a grown-up or disrespect her elders like you do.” If Kathy Brown does it, then I do not have to feel as guilty about Josiah touching me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, I bet she does," he finally answers.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I wasn’t always alone with Josiah. Sometimes he convinced my sister Sarah and even some of our friends to “play his games”. The young girls in our homeschool community who would go along with him were hungry for attention, validation, and companionship with someone older. And, sadly, there was a lack of accurate education in the homeschool community about how to keep one's body safe. A male pursuing a female was more of a reflection of how the girl must have presented herself in a sinful manner. No blame would be put on a male for his actions. The young girls were set up to be sexually abused and hide in silent shame. Years later I would learn that most sexual abuse comes from trusted neighbors, friends, church members and family members. Yet, in my family, it seemed that sexual abuse wasn’t abuse unless it came from outside the inner circle of family members and friends. Because inside, according to my parents, it was just “child’s play”. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah enjoyed watching girls together, gaining pleasure from providing specific instruction about what he wanted us to do to each other. And we would do it. The need for approval and being valued is so strong in children--especially those who are largely ignored and discounted by parents like many of us were. We would do anything for someone to enjoy our presence, even if it meant learning new, “adultlike games.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;~
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;At the tender age of seven years old, Kelsey and I began attempting to pull all-night sleepovers. Seeing who could stay up longer became a competition that I always lost. One cool and dark fall night, we set up the pull-out couch in the addition-room that Dad built onto the trailer. When my siblings came into the room, we pushed them out. They were not allowed into our best friend slumber party. The wood fire stove burned, leaving a warm and cozy feeling in the room. “You have to stay awake all night this time. You have to stay up with me because when you fall asleep then I get bored and fall asleep.” Lying on our sides with a raggedy quilt draped over us, Kelsey was using her serious voice.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I will stay up this time. I really will.” My words were certain, but we both knew that when it came down to it, I could not win a battle against my tired body. On our bed were snacks, beads for bracelet making, nail polish, and a portable compact disc player with headphones. “We have all of this fun stuff and I really think that it will help me stay awake,” I attempted to convince us both.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Kelsey sat up, pulled her fine blond hair into a low ponytail and stuck out her hand. “Okay, but you still have to pinky promise me that you won’t fall asleep tonight.” The deal was sealed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Kelsey searched her CDs: Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and NSYNC. Finally, she settled for Britney Spears latest album Oops!...I Did It Again. Taking turns with the headphones, we chatted while painting our nails.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Colorful nails were forbidden by Mom, as she believed that it was for worldly promiscuous women who sought sinful attention from males. When she was not home, I enjoyed coloring my nails with Sharpie markers, always hiding them from any of my siblings who might tattle on me. The adrenaline rush was a thrill. I could fit in with my friends and the sin did not feel real if Mom did not know about it. I only had nail polish on this occasion after somehow winning a case against her. After pleading with her all throughout Walmart, she caved when I showed her a color so light that it was invisible on my nails. I painted on multiple coats, hoping that if I did enough the faint blue would become more noticeable. This plan partially worked but ultimately, my nails barely appeared any different.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;As with most of my friends, Mom thought that Kelsey was a bad influence on me. She attended public school and exposed me to worldly things such as wearing pants, painting nails, popular music, and calling adults by their first names. Our friendship existed solely because Mom believed that I would be a good influence on her. For me, she was my ticket for fitting in with all of the other kids my age. Sure, Kelsey taught me unholy things, but she also kept me well-informed on how to connect with other friends. The lesson that I learned on this night was that all of the kids at public school were spending their recesses outside digging to China in the dirt. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The night dragged on and despite Kelsey’s attempts to keep me awake, we both slept.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Soft crackling noises came from the wood stove and the smell of freshly burnt wood filled the air.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, wake up. Come here.” Uncertain if it was a dream or real, I heard a distant voice whispering my name. When my eyes opened, the light remained on above my head. Josiah stood across the room as a shadow in the hall. A closed half smile formed on his face when he saw that he had successfully woke me. His blue eyes were fierce, not daring to look away from their prey.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Common Kelly, come here!” he continued whispering with excitement while waving me over. He started moving his tongue around, indicating that he wanted to lick me down there. My mind cleared abruptly. I was wide awake. My eyes darted to the other end of the bed and I felt relief seeing that Kelsey was still sleeping soundly. She had not witnessed what Josiah had just done. Jumping from the bed, I held my nightgown down to be sure not to expose myself any more than I already was. Desperate to leave the room before Kelsey saw what was happening, I scampered passed Josiah, down the dark hall, and straight to his bedroom.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Josiah followed. He sat next to me on the bed and put his hand on my leg. Seconds later, he stood up with an idea. When I realized what he was doing, I chased him down the hall where he was peering around the corner toward Kelsey.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly,” his face turned down at me. He was holding a smile so big that his vampire-like canine’s poked at my nerves. “Go wake her up and tell her to come back here with us," he instructed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?” I paused, looking back and forth between him and Kelsey. Hesitantly, I defied him. “No Josiah… I don’t want to.” I felt humiliated thinking about anyone knowing what Josiah and I had been doing together. I was not about to let one of my closest friends find out. Even worse, I worried she would tell our parents and feared getting into trouble.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Come on, just go wake her up. It will be fun.” 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When he started walking toward her, my hands instinctively grasped at his big hand. “Josiah, please…” I yanked him back into the hall. “I will do whatever you want, just please do not make me go get Kelsey. Please, Josiah.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	“Whatever I want?” he repeated.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Yes.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It was settled.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;~
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Days later when Kelsey went home, I headed to the back yard with two kitchen spoons. Determined to get to China before her school friends, I began digging. About one foot into my hole I was keenly aware that the process was taking longer than anticipated. “This is worse than that time I tried to mow the grass with scissors," I groaned to myself.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It was midday and the fall breeze had shifted to a beaming sun. Moving away from the hole, dirt fell from my jean skirt and my eyes caught a wooly bear caterpillar on a dead leaf beside me. Picking it up, I noticed the tickle as it crawled along my fingers and hand. Thinking it was the kind of caterpillar that turned into a monarch butterfly, I was in awe. Observing it closely, I wondered about the transforming process. It was beyond me how an ugly bug limited to slow crawling, could transform into such a flying beauty with vibrant colors.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;~
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I was ten years old when Josiah abused a family friend’s daughter, Caterina. They were both sixteen, but with cognitive delays, her personality was similar to a young girl. Mom forced me to hangout with her, even though I begged not to. I didn’t understand Caterina’s struggles, I just knew that my friends thought she was weird. And I knew that her maturity didn’t match mine.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, you are going to stay the night at Caterina Madle’s this weekend," Mom would tell me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“What?! Mom, please don’t make me go! Caterina is weird!” It wasn’t just that I looked down upon her--sometimes we truly had fun together--the issue was that her trailer was farther out in the country, surrounded by fields and rundown houses. It smelled of unwashed clothes, bird poop and stuffy sweat. Her Mom and brother seemed to have the same delays as her. I couldn’t explain it, other than that I felt uncomfortable and out of place there. Thinking back, I now wonder if that feeling was similar to how she herself felt trying to live in a world where her mind didn’t function at the same pace as others. Was she the minority surrounded by people different from her with a longing to belong?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Nope, you’re going and that is that,” Mom reprimanded. “ She has trouble making friends, and I feel bad for her. Being nice to her is what Jesus would want you to do.” No matter how much I argued, I rarely won this one. Mom invited her to our trailer just as much, which was when Josiah had the opportunity to abuse her.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;While she may have been cognitively behind, Caterina’s body was not delayed. It was so womanly. I wondered how much longer I would have to wait for such a body. That way I could get married, have kids, and live with a family of my own, leaving this entire life behind. It would be nothing like my family. We would live in an actual house with more space. I would clean regularly, making it smell nice and spend time playing with my kids. I would teach them important lessons and make sure they never went without food. My kids would have a dad who loved them. He would be my best friend, treating me with kindness. It would be safe. I could picture it clearly, but it still felt so far away. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	My body had just begun to change, which might have been what peaked my curiosity. Josiah noticed because he regularly asked me whether I had started my period. Humiliated, I always had the same response “What?! No, Josiah. Don’t ask me that!” At the time, I didn’t know why he was suddenly fixated on my period. It was not until many years later when flooded with memories of penetration that I understood he probably feared me getting me pregnant. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	I wondered if Caterina didn’t feel pain when Josiah put his fingers inside of her because of how developed her body was. Not being that far along, I screamed and cried when he put his fingers in me. “It will only hurt for a minute, just until it’s in. Then it will feel really, really good. Even better than the vibrator.” I always felt lied to when the burning continued after he got inside of me. Fortunately, he wasn’t turned on by my pain and eventually gave up when it didn’t subside. His goal was to trigger a pleasurable response from my body. It almost felt as if he were using me as an experiment, trying to find what would lead my body toward feeling the most amount of pleasure. When that didn’t happen, he found a new course.

									<br>
									<p>

										&emsp;&emsp;The basement of this building is sinking in on me. With hands cupped around my eyes, I peer through a door window. Nothing but complete darkness. Suddenly, my body lurches away, certain a zombie or vampire will burst through. My brain knows such things aren’t real, but reacts in fear before it can remember. Those scary movies my brothers watch feel undeniably true. Rushing around the corner, I slip through a curtain and into the bathroom stall with Mom for safety. She will protect me from my imagination.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Kelly, it’s just an abandoned pool on the other end of that door.” She hugs and reassures me. “Actually, before Iva’s husband died, everyone used to go in there and swim after bible quizzing!”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My mind continues battling between what it has created behind that door, versus Mom’s happy memories. I want her recollection to be true so that my body will stop shivering, but fear feels stronger. At the other end of the bathroom there are three showers, which also have curtains for privacy. It’s like an abandoned locker room, only without lockers. Up the stairs, on the main floor, is a large gymnasium-like structure that will be the site of the evening bible quizzing contest. It is an odd place: part-pool, part-gym, part-home, and I’m not sure if it’s the structure, the people, or the pressure put on me by Mom, but I’m uncomfortable here. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Continuing this tradition since I can remember, Mom brings us to bible quizzing monthly during the fall and winter. Many years before I was born, when my two eldest brothers were in elementary school, they attended a Christian School a few towns over. Mom later pulled them out for homeschooling, but she must have met someone from there who introduced her to bible quizzing. Or maybe it was someone from our homeschool group. Either is likely.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It begins every year when we receive our study pamphlets in the mail, one addressed to each of us kids. Inside of the large envelopes are thirty bible verses for us to memorize. Typically, I would spend hours studying notecards. Sometimes I would pace the trailer with a tape recorder on which I had recorded verses, pausing to finish each one the moment I recognized it--a trick I learned from Chase. The tools are helpful, but rarely get me into the top ten. As a young girl, competing against older kids is impossible. The rivalry is intense and high schoolers with the most outstanding scores receive scholarships. They take this opportunity very seriously.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On the main floor, I wait on the edge of my seat in the aged building that smells faintly of mildew. Six tables line the center of the floor, two adults sitting patiently at each one. I hear the classical version of the old Christian hymn “As the Deer” echoing from speakers set on the tables. I am one of two dozen school-aged children in folding chairs that encircle the vast all-purpose room in the building beside Iva Gilligan ’s house. Soon, the music will cut out and a monotone male voice will echo “this next question is a finish the verse question” or “this next question is a reversal question”.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Wires spread across the chairs, with a rectangular pad resting on each one. When the verse sounds, the first person off their chair steps forward to finish it at the table in front of them. The process is set up like a game show. There are electric boxes on the tables and a light will appear with the first person off their seat. Mom says that Iva’s husband began the bible quizzing tradition shortly before he died and she carries on the practice. But she often needs help so between Mom’s Godly duty and “feeling sorry” for Iva, it is common for us to have stacks of wires for the electrical boxes at home. She clips and files cable chords for the electrical box systems. They need to be done just right to fit the plug properly. A favorite pastime of mine is helping Mom, although I usually don’t file well enough and she finishes my work. Sometimes, irritation builds in my chest as I wonder how she feels sorry for other individuals yet fails to notice her own kids needs, particularly my sadness and loneliness. Regardless, we enjoy the quality time of completing the task together. Helping Mom is how I fill my void.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On the edge of my seat, I wait, hoping to hear “for God so loved…” so that I can jump and finish John 3:16, my favorite verse. The months when this verse appeared on my study sheet were my favorite. I never got it wrong. Reversal questions are the hardest. They begin with the second half of the verse, making it harder to trigger my memory. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once the scores are announced, the parents and youth leaders serve all of the children either banana split sundaes or frozen pizza reheated in the kitchen, located at the other end of the room. My favorite is the pizza months. Consuming this gourmet meal will provide the full belly I lacked all month.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Whether I was at a friends’ house or church, adults made regular comments about how much food I could devour. “You want ANOTHER serving?!” The shock in their faces provoked insecurity in me. I always thought, Abe is right… I do deserve the nickname “Kelly Belly” because I do eat too much. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t have the words to communicate that no matter how much bread, dry cereal, and ice cream I ate at home, I never felt full. To others, the monthly meals were probably similar to late evening snacks. But I couldn’t stop my body from eating at these “all you can eat” dinners. I wouldn’t have known when my nutritional needs would be met again. On nights when banana splits were served, I couldn’t even finish it. Mom was too busy to cook us meals, and rarely kept healthy food around the house, so I would have already eaten a humongous bowl of ice cream as my dinner.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This bible quizzing night will end on a good note. After filling my stomach so full that nothing else will fit, I will be outside breathing in cold Michigan air while studying the stars in the sky--or I might decide to play an outdoor game of tag with friends and siblings. Once Mom is done cleaning up, my siblings and I--or homeschool friends if it is a carpool night--will tell riddles and play the alphabet game until we fall asleep on the thirty-minute ride home. Just like my stomach, my heart will also be content.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;~
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	I’m standing in church, eyes peeking between congregants to see the “worship team”--a group of members leading the church in hymns. We are in a part of Indiana that is surrounded by cow farms, fields, and horse and buggies. Mom’s favorite pastor, Brother Gerald Dolt, will be speaking. He shares many of the same beliefs as Mom and even has around eight children, nearly as many as us, because members of this church do not believe in birth control. Instead, families trust God to choose the number of children that women bear. Women also follow the modest tradition of wearing long dresses, but identify themselves separately from the Amish women in the area. Similar to us, their hair is pulled into tight buns or braids. When left down, it falls past theirs waists. No makeup, no piercings, no nail polish. During the service, the women wear “head coverings,” a thin veil that rests on their head.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom adored Brother Gerald so much that when we couldn’t make the three hour drive on Sundays, she gathered us in the trailer for her own little service. Playing her guitar for worship, she would then force us to listen to his long sermons that took up multiple cassette tapes. If we fell asleep on these mornings from being up all night due to lack of structure, we would wake to being repeatedly hit with Mom’s hand or a metal spoon.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;In the chapel, most of the congregation would be enthusiastically singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace”, “How Great Thou Art”, or “Lord I Lift Your Name on High” and  a few members would be in a full charismatic trance, praying in tongues.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;On this day, worship seems to be taking forever. My legs are aching so I sit on a cheap folding chair behind us, hoping that Mom won’t make me stand again once she notices.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;During these services, the pastor would be preaching about how to live righteously. Or he would teach ways to guard our hearts from being tempted by Satan. Mom would listen intently, tuning out everything around her, occasionally bowing her head to pray in tongues. When she was pleased with the sermon, she spoke “Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Yes, Lord," and other words of agreeableness. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My heavy eyes, tired from boredom, are shocked awake when I hear a retching sound. Three seats to my right, Daniel’s rainbow colored vomit spews onto the floor. Vomiting--or seeing others vomit--has always been my biggest fear. Landing in survival mode, I pull my legs into my chest. Eyes squeezing shut, I bow my head into my knees and plug my ears. Still able to hear the gags, I begin a monotone hum loud enough to drown out any noise while tapping my feet repeatedly.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Once it is over, the physical sensations set in. Feeling nauseated, my hands become sweaty and shaky and I close my eyes in attempts to avoid the tunnel vision.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;It looks like an M&M McFlurry from McDonalds. That is all it is. I try convincing myself, repeating these words rapidly in my mind. But my attempts to redirect my thoughts are drowned by the lingering smell of “up-chunk.”
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The church service continues on while Mom scrubs the floor with bathroom paper towels.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“Mom, is Daniel sick?” I whisper, needing to know. I didn’t know what was happening with me at the time, but being around “puke” triggered panic attacks so severe that I feared I’m dying. But if it wasn’t the stomach flu, it wasn’t contagious and my anxiety could calm more quickly. Mom knew that.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“No, Kelly, he just ate too much candy on the drive without having breakfast.” I am not sure if I should believe her. It did make sense that this would be the cause because on those mornings when we traveled to Indiana for our full day of church, filling us with the word of God was a more pressing matter than filling us with a nutritious breakfast.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom would wake us before sunrise to prepare for our three hour trek out of state. Her bright bedroom lights confused my sleeping brain. Unable to fully wake myself, Mom would dress me while half asleep. Most of us would remain asleep in the van when we left, which meant we went without breakfast.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;This day, we stopped at a gas station for snacks along the way and Daniel bought a packet of the sour candy, Chewy Sprees. Feeling famished as a four-year-old who hasn’t eaten in fourteen hours would, he gobbled them all down before we arrived. Having nothing in his stomach but candy, it makes sense that he became ill. But my eight-year-old brain could not understand this.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I try to forget about the vomit but can’t. The room is suffocating me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Per usual, church drags on well into the afternoon because Brother Gerald stops preaching only when he feels led by the Holy Spirit, which could last hours. Desperate to make time go faster, I head for the bathroom. Removing my tights is irritating, but I will take as many bathroom breaks as I can if it means speeding the day up. I try reassuring myself: If I’m not puking in three days, then I know it isn’t the stomach flu. I need to keep moving to speed up the service, but also need to make these three days of anxiety go by as quickly as possible. In a few days I would find that Daniel had indeed eaten too many sweets. This time, no other siblings would fall ill to the stomach flu.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;~
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;When services ended, the congregation members chatted for hours. During such times, I grabbed packets of sugar that people used for their coffee and poured them into my mouth. It helped soothe my hunger pains. I would watch young mothers feeding their kids healthy snacks, pushing them on swings, or watching them play while rubbing their pregnant bellies. I stared attentively, imagining the day when I would be caring for a baby of my own and disappeared into my thoughts, wishing that I could skip forward into that dream.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;By the time we arrived at Pastor Dolt’s for afternoon lunch, my body was usually weak with hunger. They invited other church members on special occasions, but because of how far we had travelled, they mostly only hosted us. Mom typically contributed bread rolls, casseroles, or a crockpot dish and the kitchen always smelled of the best stew. Or maybe it smelled scrumptious because of my extreme hunger. They had the longest kitchen table I had ever seen. Even so, it didn’t fit both of our families and folding tables for us young kids were usually set in another room.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;After lunch, I would play with Ally, their youngest daughter who was my age. Like proper girls, we spent many hours playing imagination games with her toy kitchen set. When that became boring, we passed time by rotating between challenging each other in Yahtzee and wandering the yard chatting.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;My memories of church in Indiana were all similar to this. There were occasions in which they didn’t have a location for holding Sunday services, although I am uncertain why. When this happened, family’s volunteered their homes and we would cram into living rooms. Everything else remained exactly the same. The Cole children would spend most of our Sunday’s half asleep, uncomfortable, confused, bored--and sick to our stomachs--from either hunger or poor nutrition. The message of “How Great Thou Art” was lost in the haze of our needs not being met.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	I recall that when I was around the age of nine, we attended a pentocostal church in Watervliet, a town twenty minutes over. It was another church where women wore long dresses and hair past their waists. Similar to the Indiana congregation, they believed that women needed long hair and dresses to express their femininity and remain modest. These services didn’t go quite as long as the Indiana ones, but we attended regularly for Sunday morning and evening services, and a Tuesday night bible study.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;I typically spent services reading “Chick tracts”. These little booklets have cartoon gospel stories in them and are given to people as a form of ministry. The characters in them usually learn of scripture that applies to their life, which leads their hearts to Christ. My favorite one was called “The Little Ghost”. It was about two boys who dressed as a ghost and devil for Halloween. When they attempt to scare a girl, she states that she is not scared. She continues by giving them a lesson on sin, the devil, and Christ’s resurrection, explaining that the devil is scared of Jesus who lives in her heart. I found them much more entertaining than listening to Pastor Elijah's sermons. When I memorized enough of them, I sat back into the pew where I would either nap or practice braiding my hair.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Mom decided to have us baptized in this church. But, because the small chapel didn’t have a baptism tub, Pastor Elijah met us at another church.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;The problem was: Mom knew I didn’t want to get baptized. The times I had witnessed the dunkings frightened me; the pastor would loom over the individual and seemingly force their entire body backward into the tub, water cascading over the sides of the fiberglass fixture. When they disappeared into the water I feared a drowning would occur. These rituals were performed in front of a crowd of clapping and shouting congregants. If I was afraid of leaning backwards in the bath to get my hair washed at the trailer, then baptism was a violent plunging into the unknown.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“You have to, Kelly. You have to get baptized to get saved," Mom explained on the van ride there. As she said this, I was flooded with memories of her telling my friends similar things. I always felt humiliated when she preached at my friends, questioning them about whether or not they had accepted Jesus into their hearts. As her daughter, I didn’t have a choice. It was another inconsistency of Moms. She disagreed with the Catholic baptism of babies because she believed that individuals needed to be old enough to decide for themselves. Yet, when it came to her own children, a baptism was forced upon us as we reached an age that would appeal to the Christians in the pentacostal church. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Built into the back of the sanctuary, the tub rested in dark shadows with only one light beaming from a single bulb in the rafters. When my turn came, I stepped into the ice cold water that the pastor struggled to get warm. The coolness made my shaking anxiety even worse. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;“I now baptize you in the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit.” The pastor used the same line that he did with everyone else. When he dunked me back, I felt trapped as if I were being held underwater. My limbs flailed into survival mode, forcing me back up. Shocked from fear and chilled water, my breath caught.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;	Mom always spoke of the saving power of God. Follow God to get to heaven after death was my understanding. But what about now? I always wondered. Where is God now? The only time I felt safe with God was alone when he hugged me with his presence. Or maybe my mind created that as a survival mechanism. But even in church, my body froze in terror at the hands of Mom’s cold God who accused the mere existence of a woman in her body as a sin. I didn’t feel saved. Instead, I felt embarrassed being forced into an experience that I never wanted. After being dunked, I felt more fearful of her religion than ever. Why didn’t I feel free and whole like I was supposed to?
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;One week, after a Sunday service, Josiah caught poison ivy climbing trees in the woods behind the church. It quickly spread to his genitals which to me, felt like the best justice for touching himself and others down there so much. God was punishing him. I knew it. But mostly I felt relieved once I learned that Josiah having poison ivy meant he would not be trying to touch me.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;To my disappointment, things returned to normal the moment it healed.
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Sundays were spent learning how to be a proper woman. If a man lusted after me outside of marriage, it was a sin that would damn me to hell and I must figure out what I did to illicit that response from him and then repent. Only if God found my heart to be authentic, would he forgive me. And so on. 
										<br>
										&emsp;&emsp;Outside of church, I could never escape the demons sleeping beside me at the trailer. Each time something went wrong in my life, I knew it was God punishing me for not standing strong against Josiah. He was the ghost and devil all in one, sent to destroy me. As a Christian woman, I was to trust that God would protect me. But God didn’t protect me. He didn’t even give me parents that would protect me. For me, this confusing battle of feeling comfort in prayer and anger from being a child trapped in such horrific circumstances was the beginning of my crisis of faith. One that would haunt me well into adulthood.
